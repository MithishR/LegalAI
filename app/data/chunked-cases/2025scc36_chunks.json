    "text": " sufficient for the \nqualified technician to attest, by certificate or viva voce , that the result of the system \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n calibration check was within 10% of the target value of an alcohol standard that was \ncertified by an analyst.  The Court of Appe al also held that s.  320.34(1) of the Criminal \nCode  does not require t he prosecution to disclose any information whatsoever about \nthe target value of the alcohol standard used.  \n Held  (Côté  J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.  \n Per Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe , Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, \nO’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ.: While the Crown must disclose the target value of an \nalcohol standard t hat is certified by an analyst as part of its obligation under \ns. 320.34(1)(b) to disclose the results of the system calibration checks, the Crown need \nnot prove the target value at the time of testing in order to rely on th e presumption of \naccuracy in s.  320.31(1).  \n The purpose of the Crown ’s disclosure obligations in s.  320.34(1) is to \nensure that the accused has information sufficient to determine whether the conditions \nset out in paras.  320.31(1)(a) to (c) have been met. Section 320.34(1)(b) requires the \nCrown to disclose the “results of the system calibration checks”, as those results are \nnecessary to enable the accused to verify the proper operation of the approved \ninstrument, an d may also provide a basis for the accused to raise a reasonable doubt as \nto whether the Crown has proven all the preconditions to the presumption of accuracy. \nHowever, limiting disclosure to the results of the system calibration check would only \npartly fu lfill Parliament’s intended purpose for the disclosure obligation in \ns. 320.34(1)(b). As the target value is the set number against which the accused can \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n compare the variable system calibration check result, unless the target value at the time \nof testing i s known, one cannot understand the significance of the result of a system \ncalibration check. Therefore, the target value at the time of testing is inherently tied to \nthe results of the system calibration check and must be disclosed in addition to those \nresults. \n While the Crown must disclose the target value, it need not prove it. \nParliament did not intend to make the target value itself a statutory precondition. \nInstead,  s. 320.31(1)(a) requires proof that the qualified technician obtained a result \nthat wa s within 10% of the target value when the qualified technician conducted the \nsystem calibrat ion check. Interpreting s.  320.31(1)(a) as requiring proof of the target \nvalue at the time of testing is inconsistent with the purpose of the statutory scheme. \nProv ing the target value is an additional technical requirement that is not in line with \nParliament’s objective to simplify and streamline impaired driving prosecutions. Such \nan interpretation is also inconsistent with the text and context of s.  320.31(1)(a): it \nwould transform the data points in that provision — the results of the system calibration \ncheck and the numerical target value at the time of testing — into preconditions \nthemselves. The relationship between the precondition to the presumption of acc uracy \nin s. 320.31(1)(a) and s.  320.32 is also instructive. Under s.  320.32(1), the certificate of \nthe qualified technician is deemed admissible for the truth of its contents. Therefore, if \nthe qualified technician states that the system calibration check pro duced a result that \nwas within 10% of the target value, the Crown has proven this precondition.  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n  In the instant case, the Crown introduced into evidence a certificate from \nthe qualified technician, which stated that before each breath sample was obtained, the \nqualified technician conducted a system calibration check, the result of which was \nwithin 10% of the target value of an alcohol standard that was certified by an analyst \nas being suitable for use . Therefore, the Crown could rely on the presumption  of \naccuracy . \n Per Côté  J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowe d and an acquittal \nentered.  The target value of an alcohol standard certified by an analyst must be \ndisclosed to the accused",

    "text": "qualified technician conducted a system calibration check, the result of which was \nwithin 10% of the target value of an alcohol standard that was certified by an analyst \nas being suitable for use . Therefore, the Crown could rely on the presumption  of \naccuracy . \n Per Côté  J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowe d and an acquittal \nentered.  The target value of an alcohol standard certified by an analyst must be \ndisclosed to the accused and proven in cases where the Crown seeks to rely on the \npresumption  of accuracy. This applies to both the original target value and any \ncorrected target value established by a qualified technician at the time of testing.  \n There is agree ment with the majority that s.  320.34(1)(b) requires the \nCrown to disclose the target v alue to the defence. However, the very logic compelling \ndisclosure of the target value to the accused also supports compelling its introduction \ninto evidence in order for the Crown to rely on a statutory shortcut that all but \nguarantees a conviction . Secti on 320.31  contemplates a system calibration check, \nwhich cannot be done without the target value. This accords not only with the text of \nthe statute, but also with the dual purpose of the amendments, which is to streamline \nthe impaired driving provisions a nd to increase the reliability of technical and scientific \nevidence.  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n  If the target value is critical to the system calibration check, it is also \ncritical that it not only be disclosed to the accused but also proven by the Crown should \nit wish to rely on the statutory presumption. Compliance with the presumption of \naccuracy is incomplete without the target value. It is a crucial facet of convicting a \nperson beyond a reasonable doubt, and if Parliament intended to relieve the Crown of \nthis obligation, it wo uld have done so more explicitly. The presumption and the serious \nconsequences that flow from its application make ironclad adherence to the set \npreconditions all the more important. It is for this reason that disclosure alone is \ninsufficient and appropria te introduction into evidence is required. To hold otherwise \nwould be to condone convictions entered without giving full effect to the presumption \nof innocence and without an accused having had the opportunity to mount a full answer \nand defence.  \n At the ac cused ’s trial, though two certificates from analysts were \nintroduced into evidence, neither stated the target value of the alcohol standard, and the \ncertificate of the qualified technician contained no information about any corrected \ntarget value. Given th at the Crown failed to prove the target value of the alcohol \nstandard, it could not rely on the presumption of accuracy.  \nCases Cited  \nBy Rowe and Moreau  JJ. \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n  Applied: R. v.

    "text": " the evidentiary scheme for proving blood alcohol concentration \n(“BAC ”) for purposes of impaired operation offences under s. 320.14(1) of the \nCriminal Code .  \n[2] As in Rousselle , the appellant Mr. Larocque argues that the New \nBrunswick Court of Appeal erred in interpreting what the Crown must prove to satisfy \nthe precondition t o the presumption of accurate breath test results provided for in \ns. 320.31(1) (“presumption of accuracy”). Mr. Larocque joins Mr. Rousselle in arguing \nthat proof that an alcohol standard used in the system calibration check is certified by \nan analyst must  come from the analyst’s own evidence, either by certificate or viva \nvoce. We adopt our reasons in Rousselle which fully dealt with that issue.  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n [3] Mr. Larocque also appeals the Court of Appeal’s holding in his case that s. \n320.31(1)(a) does not require the Crown to prove the target value of an alcohol standard \nthat is certified by an analyst. These reasons address this related, but distinct, issue.  \n[4] In light of the principles articulated in Rousselle  and the reasons that \nfollow, we conclude that while the Cro wn must disclose  the target value to the accused \nas required by s. 320.34(1)(b), the Crown does not need to prove  the target value at trial \nto rely on the presumption of accuracy. Parliament did not intend to make the target \nvalue itself a precondition, on ly the fact that the qualified technician conducted a \nsystem calibration check, the result of which was within 10% of the target value. \nRequiring the Crown to prove the target value would amount to reading in an additional \ntechnical requirement in s. 320.3 1(1)(a) in a manner that is contrary to Parliament’s \nintention as regards this precondition to the presumption of accuracy.  \nII. Facts  \n[5] On August 16, 2019, Mr. Larocque was stopped by an RCMP officer at a \nsobriety checkpoint. The officer formed reasonable ground s to believe that Mr. \nLarocque had operated a motor vehicle while impaired. Mr. Larocque was arrested and \ntaken to the police station, where he provided two breath samples. An analysis of the \nsamples determined that his BAC was 110 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood (“mg \npercent”) and 120 mg percent, respectively. He was charged with having a blood \nalcohol concentration equal to or exceeding 80 mg percent within two hours of ceasing \nto operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 320.14(1)(b) (an “80 and over” off ence).  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n [6] At trial, the Crown called three witnesses: the arresting officer, the \nqualified technician, and another officer who served copies of two certificates of two \nanalysts on Mr. Larocque. The Crown also introduced into evidence the certificate of \nthe qu alified technician and two certificates of two analysts.  \nIII. Issue  \n[7] The holding in Rousselle  applies to all 80 and over cases; it provides one \nway to satisfy the requirements of s. 320.31(1)(a). However, the statutory interpretation \nissue in Rousselle  addressin g whether a qualified technician can give evidence as to the \nfact that the alcohol standard was “certified by an analyst” has no bearing on the \ndisposition of this appeal. Unlike Rousselle , the Crown in this case produced and relied \non two certificates fro m two analysts and the certificate of the qualified technician to \nsatisfy the preconditions to the presumption of accuracy.  \n[8] The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Crown must prove the target \nvalue  of an alcohol standard as part of the precondition t o the presumption of accuracy \nin s. 320.31(1)(a):  \n(a) before each sample was taken, the qualified technician conducted a \nsystem blank test the result of which is not more than 10 mg of alcohol in \n100 mL of blood and a system calibration check the result of  which is \nwithin 10% of the target value of an alcohol standard  that is certified by an \nanalyst;  \nIV. Decisions Below  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n A. New Brunswick Provincial Court (Landry J.)  \n[9] At trial, Mr. Larocque argued that the Crown had not adduced evidence",

Decisions Below  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n A. New Brunswick Provincial Court (Landry J.)  \n[9] At trial, Mr. Larocque argued that the Crown had not adduced evidence of \nthe target value and that t he qualified technician’s evidence concerning the target value \nof an alcohol standard that is certified by an analyst is inadmissible hearsay. \nMr. Larocque also argued that the two certificates of two analysts were inadmissible \nbecause they were copies of a copy and prepared pursuant to the old s. 258(1)(f) of the \nCriminal Code . \n[10] The trial judge declined to follow the Alberta Court of Appeal’s decision \nin R. v. Goldson , 2021 ABCA 193, 406 C.C.C. (3d) 84. She followed other appellate \nauthorities from across C anada which held that the fact that the alcohol standard was \ncertified by an analyst may be proved through either the evidence of the qualified \ntechnician or the analyst. Therefore, the Crown could rely on the presumption of \naccuracy whether or not the two  certificates of two analysts were admissible. The trial \njudge went on to find that, even if she was wrong about the certificate of the qualified \ntechnician, the two certificates of two analysts were admissible to prove that the alcohol \nstandard was certif ied. The trial judge did not consider whether the Crown had to prove \nthe target value of an alcohol standard.  \n[11] Having satisfied the preconditions to the presumption of accuracy, the trial \njudge convicted Mr. Larocque of having a BAC that was equal to or ove r 80 mg percent \nwithin two hours of operating a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 320.14(1)(b) of the \nCriminal Code .  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n B. New Brunswick Court of King’s Bench, 2023 NBKB 72 (Léger J.)  \n[12] Mr. Larocque appealed his conviction on several grounds. Only one \nground of appea l is before this Court — the trial judge’s interpretation of s. 320.31(1) \nof the Criminal Code . On that issue, before the summary conviction appeal judge, \nMr. Larocque argued that the Crown could not prove that the alcohol standard was \ncertified through th e certificate of the qualified technician.  \n[13] The summary conviction appeal judge considered both Goldson and the \nYukon Court of Appeal’s reasons in R. v. MacDonald , 2022 YKCA 7, 419 C.C.C. (3d) \n100, which had not been released at the time of Mr. Larocque’s t rial decision. The \nsummary conviction appeal judge agreed with the reasoning in MacDonald , and held \nthat the trial judge did not err in holding that the certificate of the qualified technician \nwas sufficient to prove all preconditions to the presumption of  accuracy in s. 320.31(1). \nThe summary conviction appeal judge did not explicitly address whether the Crown \nmust prove the target value of an alcohol standard.  \n[14] The summary conviction appeal judge dismissed the appeal and confirmed \nMr. Larocque’s conviction . \nC. New Brunswick Court of Appeal, 2024 NBCA 4, 433 C.C.C.

In the \nCourt of Appeal’s view, it is sufficient for the qualified technician to attest, by \ncertificate or  viva voce , that the result of the system calibration check was within 10% \nof the target value  of an alcohol standard that was certified by an analyst. The qualified \ntechnician must know the target value in order to administer the system calibration \ncheck.

Holding that the \nCrown must satisfy each aspect of the preconditions offsets the fact that the new \ns. 320.31(1)(a) no longer allows the accused to present evidence to the contrary in \nchallenging the presumption of accuracy.  \n[19] Furth er, in a similar vein to Mr. Rousselle’s submissions in the companion \ncase, Mr. Larocque submits that evidence of the target value must come from the \nanalyst rather than the qualified technician. The analyst knows the target value that the \nalcohol standard  should produce because it is the analyst who certifies that the alcohol \nstandard is suitable for use. By contrast, the qualified technician learns the target value \nonly by reviewing, for example, the label on the bottle of alcohol standard. The \nqualified technician’s evidence of target value is, therefore, inadmissible hearsay.  \n[20] The Crown submits that Mr. Larocque’s approach would read a new \ntechnical requirement into s. 320.31(1)(a) that Parliament did not intend to include. The \nqualified technician’s evidence that the results of the system calibration check were \nwithin 10% of the target value is sufficient. Put another way, s. 320.31(1)(a) requires \nproof that the system calibration check produced a result that indicates the approved \ninstrument is funct ioning properly, not proof of the target value itself.  \nVI. Analysis  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n [21] In determining whether the Crown must prove the target value as part of \nthe precondition in s. 320.31(1)(a), we rely on our analysis set out in Rousselle , \nincluding: the summary of breath alc ohol testing procedures, the statutory scheme for \n80 and over prosecutions, and the principles of statutory interpretation. Further, as in \nRousselle , we have taken notice of certain undisputed facts that are relevant background \nto understanding the statuto ry interpretation question at issue in this appeal.  \nA. The Target Value Must Be Disclosed Under Section 320.34(1)(b)  \n[22] We begin by addressing whether the Crown must disclose the target value \nas of the time of testing under s. 320.34(1)(b). This question is dire ctly related to the \nissue on appeal, and the Court has the benefit of submissions from the parties and \nreasons from the New Brunswick Court of Appeal.  \n[23] We agree with the interveners, the Attorneys General of Alberta and British \nColumbia, that the target val ue falls within the Crown’s mandatory disclosure \nobligation in s. 320.34(1)(b) of the Criminal Code . Crown counsel conceded this point \nat the hearing.  \n[24] The purpose of the Crown’s disclosure obligations in s. 320.34(1) is to \nensure that the accused has “inf ormation sufficient to determine whether the conditions \nset out in paragraphs 320.31(1)(",

Crown counsel conceded this point \nat the hearing.  \n[24] The purpose of the Crown’s disclosure obligations in s. 320.34(1) is to \nensure that the accused has “inf ormation sufficient to determine whether the conditions \nset out in paragraphs 320.31(1)(a) to (c) have been met”. Section 320.34(1)(b) requires \nthe Crown to disclose the “results of the system calibration checks” to the accused.  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n [25] One can readily understand  why Parliament requires the Crown to disclose \nthe results of the system calibration check when the evidentiary scheme is considered \nas a whole. The results of the system calibration checks are necessary to enable the \naccused to verify the proper operation  of the approved instrument. It may also, \ndepending on the circumstances of the case, provide a basis for the accused to raise a \nreasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has proven all the preconditions to the \npresumption of accuracy. For example, if the C rown proceeds by producing the \ncertificate of the qualified technician, the results of the system calibration check may \nform the basis for arguing the likely relevance of cross -examining the qualified \ntechnician’s assertion that a system calibration was co nducted, the result of which was \nwithin 10% of the target value under s. 320.32(3).   \n[26] However, limiting disclosure to the results of the system calibration check \nwould only partly fulfill Parliament’s intended purpose for the disclosure obligation in \ns. 32 0.34(1)(b). Section 320.34(1)(b) also requires the target value of an alcohol \nstandard to be disclosed.  \n[27] The target value is the “set” number against which the accused can \ncompare the “variable” system calibration check result (K. Jokinen and P. Keen, \nImpai red Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences  (2nd ed. 2023), at \np. 341). Unless the target value at the time of testing is known, one cannot understand \nthe significance of the result of a system calibration check (see R. v. Vigneault , 2024 \nQCCA 793 , at para. 21). Unlike the system blank check, where the expected result is \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n set out in the Criminal Code  itself — the approved instrument passes if it produces a \nresult under 10 mg percent — the system calibration check asks only whether the result \nis “wit hin 10% of the target value”. In other words, the precondition is not seeking one \nspecific  alcohol concentration, but instead a factual determination of whether the \napproved instrument produces a result within the margins  dictated by the target value. \nFor example, if the accused does not know that the target value at the time of testing \nwas 100 mg percent, knowing that a system calibration check produced a result of 97 \nmg percent — which is within 10% of the target value — is not useful.  \n[28] Therefore, the Cou rt of Appeal erred in holding that s. 320.34(1)(b) \nrequires the Crown to disclose the results of the system calibration checks but “does \nnot require the prosecution to disclose any information whatsoever about the target \nvalue of the alcohol standard used”  (para. 49). In our view, the target value at the time \nof testing is inherently tied to the results of the system calibration check, and must be \ndisclosed in addition to those results.  \n[29] We note, as a related point, that the target value can be disclosed to  the \naccused through several different sources depending on the type of alcohol standard \n(dry gas or wet bath) used in the system calibration check. Section 320.34(1)(b) \nimposes an obligation on the Crown to disclose the results of the system calibration \ncheck, including the target value, but does not specify how disclosure is to be effected. \nUnlike, for example, s. 320.34(1)(e), which specifically requires disclosure of “a \ncertificate of an analyst”, the Crown does not need to disclose a particular documen t to \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n comply with its obligation under s. 320.34(1)(b).

To that end, the target value does not \nnecessarily need to come from the certificate of the analyst.  \n[30] For dry gas alcohol standards, the qualified technician has direct \nknowledge of the corrected  target  value, which is based on barometric pressure at the \ntime and place of testing. The baseline sea -level target value for a dry gas alcohol \nstandard (82 mg percent) is normally printed on the gas cylinder used in the system \ncalibration check (see, e.g., R. v. Kelly , 2023 NSPC 19, at para. 20; R. v. Cardwell , \n2022 BCPC 308, at para. 14), and would be known only to the analyst who certified \nthe cylinder. However, the target value that is relevant to the system calibration check \n— the corrected target value — is determined by the approved instrument at the testing \nlocation. Therefore, it is the qualified technician who can produce the corrected target \nvalue in their certificate. The analyst is not in a position to know the corrected target \nvalue for a particular system calibration check. The corrected target value may also \nappear, at least for the Intox EC/IR II, alongside the results of the system calibration \nchecks on the approved instrument printout ( R. v. Underhill , 2020 NBPC 3, 61 M.V.R. \n(7th) 31, at para. 44 ; see also Arkansas Department of Health, Intoximeter EC/IR II: \nSenior Operator Training Manual  (2023), at p. 4 -1). \n[31] The target value for a wet bath alcohol standard is a constant 100 mg \npercent (Jokinen and Keen, at p. 340). While it will be known to the a nalyst who \ncertifies that the alcohol standard is suitable for use, the qualified technician is also \ncompetent, by virtue of the qualified technician’s training in this area, to assert that the \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n \n target value for a wet bath alcohol standard is 100 mg percent  (see, e.g., R. v. Pelaia , \n2019 ONCJ 676, 58 M.V.R. (7th) 338, at para. 53; R. v. Lafontaine , 2020 QCCQ 3575, \nat para. 23; R. v. Le , 2025 ONCJ 86, 572 C.R.R. (2d) 353, at para. 44; R. v. Hepfner , \n2022 ONSC 6064, at para. 69).  \n[32] We also agree with the Court of Appeal that the text of s. 320.31(1)(a) \nindicates Parliament did not intend that the target value would be something known \nonly to the analyst. The English and French versions of a bilingual statute are equally \nauthoritative; the shared meaning of a pro vision governs ( R. v. Quesnelle , 2014 SCC \n46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 53). The English text of s. 320.31(1)(a) states “the \ntarget value of an alcohol standard that is certified by an analyst”. However, the French \ntext, which states “ la valeur cible d e l’alcool type certifié par un analyste ”, is clear that \ntarget value is not linked to the analyst’s knowledge of an alcohol standard’s suitability \nfor use. “ [V]aleur cible ” (feminine noun) is not grammatically linked to “ alcool type ” \n(masculine noun), and , “certifié ” is singular, which means it does not apply to both the \ntarget value and the alcohol standard (C.A. reasons, at para. 50). This interpretation \nmakes sense viewed in light of our discussion above. It cannot have been Parliament’s \nintention to pe rmit only the analyst to disclose something that the analyst does not \nknow, in the case of a dry gas corrected target value, or something that is known to \nboth the analyst and the qualified technician, in the case of a wet bath target value.  \nB.

Proof of the T arget Value Is Not a Precondition to the Presumption of Accuracy  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n [33] While the Crown must disclose the target value as part of its obligation \nunder s. 320.34(1)(b) to disclose the results of the system calibration checks, we \ndisagree with Mr. Larocque that the  Crown must prove the target value at the time of \ntesting in order to rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 320.31(1). Parliament did \nnot intend to make the target value itself  a statutory precondition. Instead, s. \n320.31(1)(a) requires proof that the qualified technician obtained a result that was \nwithin 10% of the  target value  when the qualified technician conducted the system \ncalibration check.  \n[34] Interpreting s. 320.31(1)(a) as requiring proof of the target value at the time \nof testing is inconsistent with the purpose of the An Act  to amend the Criminal Code \n(offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other \nacts, S.C. 2018, c. 21 . We agree with the Crown that proving the target value is an \nadditional technical requirement that is not in line with Parliament’s objective to \nsimplify and streamline 80 and over prosecutions (see Rousselle , at paras. 102 -5; R. v. \nWolfe , 2024 SCC 34, at para. 78).  \n[35] Mr. Larocque’s interpretation is also inconsistent with the text and the \ncontext of  s. 320.31(1)(a). The proposed interpretation would transform the data points \nin s. 320.31(1)(a) — the results of the system calibration check and the numerical target \nvalue at the time of testing — into preconditions themselves. Mr. Larocque submits \nthere  is support for his view in Vigneault , where the Quebec Court of Appeal held that \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n affirmation of the target value itself is “not an element of picayune detail”, but rather \nessential to establishing the accuracy of the system calibration check (paras. 25 -26). \n[36] We agree with the Quebec Court of Appeal in Vigneault  to this extent: the \ntarget value is essential to understanding the results of the system calibration check. As \ndiscussed above, this is why the target value is to be disclosed under s. 320.34(1)(b). \nHowever, it misapprehends Parliament’s intention to treat this as a precondition for s. \n320.31(1)(a).  \n[37] The presumption of accuracy is based on the scientific consensus that when \nspecific procedures are followed, a person’s breath alcohol test results accur ately \nreflect their BAC at the time of testing (see s. 320.12). For this reason, s. 320.31(1)(a) \nrefers to two procedures that the qualified technician must perform before obtaining a \nbreath alcohol sample: the system blank check and the system calibration  check. In \nregard to the system calibration check portion of s. 320.31(1)(a), Parliament requires \nthat the Crown prove that the qualified technician conducted the check according to the \nspecific procedures set by the Canadian Society of Forensic Science’s Alcohol Test \nCommittee. Parliament has not required that the Crown prove the actual results  of the \nsystem calibration check or the target value. While those data points must be disclosed, \nproving them at trial is not a precondition to the presumption of ac curacy.  \n[38] As discussed in Rousselle , the relationship between the precondition to the \npresumption of accuracy in s. 320.31(1)(a) and s. 320.32 is also instructive. Under \ns. 320.32(1), the certificate of the qualified technician is deemed admissible for the \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n truth of its contents.

Therefore, if the qualified technician states that the system \ncalibration check produced a result that was within 10% of the target value, the Crown \nhas proven this s. 320.31(1)(a) precondition. The accused may apply to cross -examine \nthe qualified technician on the certificate under s. 320.32(3) if the disclosure — which \nincludes the results of the system calibration check and the target value at the time of \ntesting — shows that the system calibration check was not performed in accorda nce \nwith the Criminal Code  (e.g., the result was not within 10% of the target value, or the \nprintout shows an error occurred during the system calibration check, etc.).  \n[39] Therefore, we reject Mr. Larocque’s arguments that s. 320.31(1)(a) should \nbe interpret ed strictly to preserve the rights of an accused person. There is no ambiguity \nin what the Crown must establish to prove the precondition to the presumption of \naccuracy in s. 320.31(1)(a). The Crown may choose to introduce the underlying data \nfrom the enti re breath alcohol testing process into evidence. However, as a matter of \nstatutory interpretation, the Criminal Code  does not require that evidence to be \nintroduced in order to rely on the presumption of accuracy. Where the Crown has \nproven the preconditio ns to the presumption of accuracy, a finding of guilt will \nordinarily follow, as Parliament intended.  \nVII. Application  \n[40] In this case, the Crown introduced into evidence a certificate from the \nqualified technician who administered Mr. Larocque’s breath alcohol t ests. That \ncertificate stated that before each breath sample was obtained, the qualified technician \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n \n conducted [ TRANSLATION ] “a system calibration check, the result of which was within \n10% of the target value of an alcohol standard  that was certified by an analyst as being \nsuitable for use with the Intox EC/IR II” (A.R., tab 13, at p. 98 (emphasis added)).We \nagree with the Court of Appeal that, by virtue of the hearsay exception in s. 320.32(1), \nthis assertion meets the Crown’s onus to prove the relevant por tion of the precondition \nin s. 320.31(1)(a).  \n[41] It is not disputed that the Crown has proven the balance of the requirements \nof s. 320.31(1)(a) and the remaining preconditions beyond a reasonable doubt. \nTherefore, the courts below did not err in concluding t hat the Crown could rely on the \npresumption in s. 320.31(1) that Mr. Larocque’s breath tests results are conclusive \nproof of his BAC at the time of testing.  \nVIII. Conclusion  \n[42] For all these reasons, the Crown is not required to prove the target value of \nan alcohol  standard used in the system calibration check in order to satisfy the \nprecondition to the presumption of accuracy in s. 320.31(1)(a).  \n[43] We would dismiss the appeal and affirm Mr. Larocque’s conviction.  \n The following are the reasons delivered by  \n CÔTÉ J. —  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n \n I. Overview  \n[44] This appeal, like the companion appeal in R. v. Rousselle , 2025 SCC 35, \nrequires our Court to interpret Parliament’s 2018 amendments to the Criminal Code , \nR.S.C. 1985, c.  C-46, relating to impaired driving. As explained in Rousselle , those \namendm ents created a statutory presumption of accuracy when an approved instrument \nis used to test blood alcohol concentration. But, part and parcel of that statutory \npresumption is a critical balancing component: a system calibration check, which \nprovides an as surance of accuracy. In this appeal, we are called upon to determine \nwhether the Crown must not only disclose, but also prove a crucial aspect of a system \ncalibration check  — the target value of an alcohol standard that is certified by an \nanalyst  — in orde r to rely on the presumption of",

But, part and parcel of that statutory \npresumption is a critical balancing component: a system calibration check, which \nprovides an as surance of accuracy. In this appeal, we are called upon to determine \nwhether the Crown must not only disclose, but also prove a crucial aspect of a system \ncalibration check  — the target value of an alcohol standard that is certified by an \nanalyst  — in orde r to rely on the presumption of accuracy. I am of the view that the \ntarget value of an alcohol standard certified by an analyst must be disclosed to the \naccused and proven in cases where the Crown seeks to rely on the presumption of \naccuracy. This applies to both the original target value and any corrected target value \nestablished by a qualified technician at the time of testing.  \n[45] Section  320.31(1) of the Criminal Code  sets out the preconditions that the \nCrown must meet in order to be able to rely on the pre sumption of accuracy. In essence, \nif those preconditions are satisfied, the test results may be conclusively relied upon as \nevidence against the accused. That is because approved instruments used to measure \nblood alcohol concentration are scientifically re liable and, by design, capable of \nproducing trustworthy results . However, reliance on such results is justified only where \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n \n the statutory preconditions have been strictly and rigorously met  — particularly given \nthat the presumption makes conviction nearly i nevitable, imposes criminal liability, and \nhas serious consequences for the accused.  \n[46] One of these preconditions, set out in s.  320.31(1)(a), is premised on a \nsystem calibration check. Mr.  Larocque asserts that as part of that system calibration \ncheck, the target value of the alcohol standard used must be proven before the \npresumption of accuracy can be relied upon. I agree. The target value is critical to a \nproper calibration procedure and to the verification of the instrument’s accuracy. Given \nthe central importance of the target value to testing the reliability of the process, the \npresumption of innocence and an accused’s right to mount a full answer and defence \nto charges against him or her demand both the disclosure and proof of the target value \nin order  for the presumption of accuracy to be relied upon. The statutory presumption \ndoes not eliminate the truth -seeking function of the trial ( R. v. Flores -Vigil , 2019 ONCJ \n192, 50 M.V.R. (7th) 162, at para.  18). \n[47] These reasons are released together with my reas ons in the companion \nappeal, Rousselle , on which I rely for the background regarding the operation of the \nimpaired driving regime, the review of the conflicting appellate jurisprudence, and the \noverall statutory interpretation analysis in determining the o utcome of the present \nappeal as well. Before moving on to the analysis, I will review the facts and history \nnecessary to understand the only issue brought by this appeal.  \nII. Facts and Procedural History  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n \n A. Facts  \n[48] A peace officer pulled Mr.  Larocque over and forme d reasonable grounds \nto believe that he had operated a motor vehicle while impaired. After being arrested \nand taken to the police station, Mr.  Larocque provided two breath samples. The first \nwas found to contain 110  mg of alcohol in 100  mL of blood (“mg pe rcent”), and the \nother 120  mg percent. He was subsequently charged with having operated a motor \nvehicle with a blood alcohol concentration exceeding 80  mg percent within two hours \nafter ceasing to operate the vehicle.  \nB. New Brunswick Provincial Court (Landry  J.) \n[49] At trial, the Crown introduced as evidence a certificate of a qualified \ntechnician and two certificates from two different analysts. The qualified \ntechnician  — in addition to testifying  — attested in his certificate that he performed a \nsystem calibrat ion check that received a result within 10% of the target value of an \nalcohol standard that was certified by an analyst as suitable for that device. Neither of \nthe two analysts testified. Their certificates attested not to certifying the alcohol \nstandard, but rather to the alcohol standard being suitable for use with an approved \ninstrument.  \n[50] As it related to whether the preconditions to the presumption of accuracy \nfound within s.  320.31(1) were met, Landry  J. relied on the line of authority considered \n",

Denis , 2021 MBQB 39, 77 M.V.R. (7th) 38, primarily in holding that \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n \n s. 320.31(1) required proof that the alcohol standard had been certified by an analyst \nbut that it could be proven by way of the certificate of the qualified technician. There \nwas no con sideration of whether the Crown had to prove the target value.  \nC. New Brunswick Court of King’s Bench, 2023 NBKB 72 (Léger  J.) \n[51] In interpreting ss.  320.31(1) and 320.32, Léger  J. surveyed the \njurisprudential divide between R. v. Goldson , 2021 ABCA 193, 406 C.C .C. (3d) 84,  \nand R. v. MacDonald , 2022 YKCA 7, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 100. He ultimately opted to \nfollow the line of reasoning adopted in MacDonald  to the effect that the legislative \namendments did not represent a shift in the law but rather included “innocuous” \nchanges. Relying on MacDonald and R. v. Hepfner , 2022 ONSC 6064, he concluded \nthat the Crown need not go beyond the certificate of the qualified technician or oral \nevidence as to the fact of the alcohol standard’s certification. Léger  J. was satisfied that  \nLandry  J. had not made an error in law in concluding that all the preconditions of \ns. 320.31(1) had been met, particularly given that she had both the certificate of the \nqualified technician and the certificate of the analyst. There was, again, no \nconside ration of whether the target value had to be proven by the Crown.  \nD. New Brunswick Court of Appeal, 2024 NBCA 4, 433 C.C.C.

(3d) 31,  in rejecting Mr.  Larocque’s first argument that only \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n \n hearsay evidence from the qualified technician was tendered to prove that the alcohol \nstandard had been certified by an analyst.  \n[53] But Mr.  Larocque argued not only that the Crown cannot rely solely on the \nhearsay evidence of a qualified technician to prove that the alcohol standard has been \n“certified by an analyst”, but also that the statute imposes an obligation on the Crown \nto prove the target value of the alcohol standard in order to meet the conditions set out \nin s. 320.31(1). On this point, the Court of Appeal concluded that “the certificate of the \nqualified technician was admissible as evidence of the facts stated therein, including \n. . . the fact that the result of the system calib ration check was within 10% of the target \nvalue of the certified alcohol standard” (para.  54). \n[54] In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Appeal first canvassed relevant \nappellate and lower court decisions. In addition to its review of those authorities,  it \nemphasized the importance of the role of the qualified technician, which it outlined at \npara.  43: \nIt is accepted that a proper calibration procedure is the key to verifying \nthe accuracy of an approved instrument. To conduct the system calibration \ncheck , the qualified technician ascertains that the approved instrument is \nin proper working order by measuring a sample (alcohol standard) \ncontaining a known alcohol concentration (target value). At this \npreliminary stage, the blood alcohol concentration indic ated by the \napproved instrument is compared with an objective and reliable \nmeasurement standard, i.e., the target value of the alcohol standard \ncertified by an analyst.

At this \npreliminary stage, the blood alcohol concentration indic ated by the \napproved instrument is compared with an objective and reliable \nmeasurement standard, i.e., the target value of the alcohol standard \ncertified by an analyst. A system calibration check  that gives a certain \nresult only makes sense if the target v alue of the alcohol standard is known . \nObviously, the qualified technician must know this target value  in order to \ncompare it with the result of the system calibration check. Whether he or \nshe obtains  this information from a label attached to the cylinder containing \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n the certified alcohol standard, from a document accompanying the \ncylinder, from the analyst’s certificate or from another source, it is his or \nher duty to know the target value of the alcohol standard he or she is using \nto check that the approve d instrument is in proper working order. \n[Emphasis added.]  \n[55] The Court of Appeal emphasized that there was no reason to doubt the \nqualified technician’s expertise; nothing in the evidence cast any doubt on the facts \nalleged in the certificate of the qualified technician, the proper working order of the \napproved instrument, or its operation (para.  46). It found that “nothing in s.  320.31(1) \nrequires confirmation of the information contained in the qualified technician’s \ncertificate” (para.  47). Further more, it noted that, although Parliament requires the \nprosecution to disclose certain information to the accused to enable them to determine \nwhether the conditions in s.  320.31(1) have been met, it does not require the \nprosecution to disclose any informati on about the target value of the alcohol standard \nused: “If Parliament did not consider it necessary to require the disclosure of the target \nvalue or to otherwise require that the target value be stated in the analyst’s certificate, \nit cannot have intended  to require the prosecution to file an analyst’s certificate \nindicating the target value or to otherwise prove that information” (para.  49). \n[56] In summary, Mr.  Larocque’s appeal asks whether the Crown is required to \ndisclose and prove the target value of the alcohol standard and how it must go about \nproving it.  \nIII. Analysis  \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n A. The Target Value Is Key to a Proper Calibration Procedure and to Verification  \n[57] The importance of t .he target value to the calibration procedure and to \nverification should not be controversial. I ts centrality to calibration was recognized in \nFlores -Vigil , at para.  30: \nThe alcohol standard’s usefulness in a calibration procedure depends \nentirely upon it containing a known concentration of alcohol, which \nexplains Parliament inserting the requirement  that the alcohol standard be \n“certified by an analyst”. Calibration by definition requires the use of a \nknown standard, whose value is not in dispute. Certification provides the \nnecessary assurance of the concentration of the standard against which the \ndevice will be tested. In this context, the phrase “target value” must refer \nto the known/actual concentration of alcohol in the alcohol standard, as \nestablished through the certification of an analyst. The device’s accuracy \nis only established when the cali bration test provides a result that is \nsufficiently close to this target value. Parliament has thus indicated that \nsuccessful calibration, within the meaning ordinarily assigned to that term, \nis a fundamental precondition to the existence of a presumption of \naccuracy. Read in its ordinary and grammatical sense, in the context of the \nprovision as a whole, and with the obvious intent of parliament, the phrase \nin question clearly contemplates a process by which the accuracy of a \nmeasuring device can be assured  by commanding that device to test an \nalcohol standard that contains a known concentration, so as to ascertain \nwhether or not the device accurately measures the known sample. \nCertification of that known sample  — the alcohol standard  — provides the \nnecessar y assurance of the known sample’s true alcohol concentration. \nThis is the only way to rationally interpret the application and purpose of \nsection  320.31(1).  \n[58] My colleagues acknowledge that unless “the target value at the time of \ntesting is known, one cannot  understand the significance of the result of a system \ncalibration check” (para.  27).

They also acknowledge that the system calibration check \nis “a factual determination of whether the approved instrument produces a result within \nthe margins  dictated by th e target value” (para.  27 (emphasis in original)). I agree with \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n my colleagues that the target value is of critical importance to the assessment of the \nintegrity of the system calibration check.  \n[59] Healy  J.A., writing for the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Vigneault , 2024 \nQCCA 793, also recognized the importance of the target value to the integrity of the \nsystem calibration check. To be clear, I disagree with Healy  J.A.’s acceptance of the \nreasoning in MacDonald , Rousselle (C.A.), and the decision of the Cou rt of Appeal in \nthis case  to the effect that a certificate of a qualified technician can prove that the \nalcohol standard was certified by an analyst, and I also disagree with his conclusion \nthat evidence of the target value can be furnished by either the q ualified technician or \nthe analyst. That said, I agree entirely with his analysis and his conclusion that the \nCrown must introduce evidence that explicitly refers to the target value of the alcohol \nstandard in order to rely on the presumption of accuracy. At paragraph  25, he states:  \n. . . only with an affirmation of the target value of the alcohol standard is \nthe evidence of compliance with the presumption of accuracy complete. \nWithout that affirmation, accuracy cannot be presumed. The target value \nused to certify the standard is what allows the accuracy of the results of the \ntests administered in the instant case to be established beyond reasonable \ndoubt.  \n[60] The significance of the target value was also noted by the Court of Appeal \nitself: “.  . . the qualified  technician must know th[e] target value in order to compare it \nwith the result of the system calibration check” (para.  43). Despite recognizing its \nsignificance, the Court of Appeal took the position that the Crown need not prove it, or \nshare it with the defence (para.  49). \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n B. The Presumption of Innocence Demands Disclosure and Introduction Into \nEvidence of the Target Value  \n[61] My colleagues in the majority rightly take issue with the conclusion of the \nCourt of Appeal regarding disclosure and find that s.  320.34( 1)(b) does indeed require \nthe Crown to disclose the target value to the defence (para.  28). I find the majority’s \nrationale in support of disclosure compelling; they rightfully cite Vigneault with \napproval and state that “the target value is essential to u nderstanding the results of the \nsystem calibration check” (para.  36). I therefore agree that the Court of Appeal erred \nin holding that s.  320.34(1)(b) does not require the prosecution to disclose any \ninformation about the target value of the alcohol standa rd used (para.  28). \n[62] I part ways with my colleagues, however, where they find that the very \nlogic compelling disclosure of the target value to the accused does not also support \ncompelling its introduction into evidence in order for the Crown to rely on a st atutory \nshortcut that all but guarantees a conviction (para.  37). \n[63] In order to know that the qualified technician conducted a system \ncalibration check, the result of which was within 10% of the target value of an alcohol \nstandard that was certified by an an alyst, one must first know  the target value. In effect, \nthe target value is key to the proper calibration procedure because it acts as the \n“comparator”. Where a qualified technician establishes a corrected target value at the \ntime of testing, this value is  also a relevant comparator that must be disclosed and \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n proven. Requiring its disclosure under s.  320.34(1) is important, but on its own it is \ninsufficient to meet the preconditions for the presumption of accuracy to operate.  \n[",

Requiring its disclosure under s.  320.34(1) is important, but on its own it is \ninsufficient to meet the preconditions for the presumption of accuracy to operate.  \n[64] I agree entirely that the 2018 regime contemplates a calibration \nverification, which cannot be done without the target value, as Vigneault makes clear. \nThis accords not only with the text of the statute, as Flores -Vigil  emphasizes, but also \nwith the dual purpose of the amendments, which  is to streamline the impaired driving \nprovisions and to increase the reliability of technical and scientific evidence.  \n[65] If we accept that the target value is critical to the system calibration check, \nwe must also accept that it is critical that it be not o nly disclosed to the accused but also \nproven  by the Crown should it wish to rely on the statutory presumption. In fact, both \nthe presumption of innocence and the right of a defendant to mount a full answer and \ndefence demand such acceptance.  \n[66] I agree with t he conclusion reached by Healy  J.A. of the Quebec Court of \nAppeal that evidence of compliance with the presumption of accuracy is incomplete \nwithout the target value ( Vigneault , at para.  25). It is a crucial facet of convicting a \nperson beyond a reasonable  doubt, and if Parliament intended to relieve the Crown of \nthis obligation, and by extension deprive accused persons of the ability to mount a full \nanswer and defence, it would have done so more explicitly. Healy  J.A. was correct \nwhen he said the following , at para.  26: \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n This is not an element of picayune detail  when the issue is viewed in its \ncontext. The presumption of accuracy is the mechanism that allows the \nprosecution to prove the central element of a criminal offence. That \nelement marks the difference  between a finding of guilt and an acquittal. \nIn this regard the presumption of innocence is maintained or defeated by \nthe presumption of accuracy.  The convenience of proof afforded to the \nprosecution must be interpreted in a manner that reflects the impor tance of \naccuracy in the determination of the jeopardy to which an accused person \nis exposed. In short, while Parliament may seek to simplify the law with \nrespect to the prosecution of offences for impaired driving, it must not do \nso in a manner that reduc es the burden of proof to a paper formality that \nderives its value solely from hearsay.  [Emphasis added.]  \n[67] This excerpt underlines the seriousness of the consequences an accused \nfaces when the Crown relies on the presumption of accuracy. Accordingly, our \ninterpretation must be carried out with those serious consequences in mind. \nMr. Larocque is right to point to R. v. Egger , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, as an impaired \ndriving case where our Court considered the seriousness of these consequences for the \naccused and t ook that into account in its interpretation of the statutory provision (A.F., \nat paras.  42-43). That case concerned the furnishing of certificates by an analyst and a \nqualified technician, leading Sopinka  J. to write that the interpretation of the provisio n \nat issue in that case had to be “approached keeping in mind the accused’s right to make \nfull answer and defence” (p.  466). He went on to state that the interpretation must be \nin accordance, where reasonably possible, with the principle that “the Crown ha s a duty \nto disclose to the accused all information reasonably capable of affecting the accused’s \nability to make full answer and defence” as that obligation had “constitutional \nunderpinnings” stemming from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  \n(p. 466). \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n [68] Mr. Larocque’s arguments accord with the Quebec Court of Appeal’s \ndecision in Vigneault , in which it was also held that the principle of strict construction \nof penal statutes applies and that a “ relaxation of the prosecution’s burden to prove an \nessen tial element of the offence must be strictly construed to avoid an interpretation \nthat would make the prosecution’s burden perfunctory” (para.  23).

I agree. The \noverarching goal of the legislation cannot trump the clear intention of Parliament to \nreinforce  the requirements of the evidentiary preconditions of the presumption, or, as \nHealy  J.A. put it, render the Crown’s burden “perfunctory”. This is not to say that the \npresumption of accuracy should not be adhered to; rather, we must give effect to the \npreco nditions set out by Parliament, which are premised on a robust system calibration \ncheck process to which we must also adhere and to which the target value is critical.  \n[69] The presumption of accuracy, and its preconditions set out in s.  320.31(1), \ncannot be co nflated or confused with the disclosure obligations set out in s.  320.34(1). \nThe obligations under the latter should not  — and cannot  — be seen as a relaxation of \nthe preconditions set out in the former ( Vigneault v. R. , 2021 QCCS 3341, at para.  35). \n[70] I ack nowledge that the disclosure of a piece of information, as required by \ns. 320.34(1), is different than its actual introduction  into evidence. Indeed, at an \nordinary trial, the Crown may disclose far more material to the accused than it \nultimately introduce s into evidence. However, in such a situation, contrary to here, the \nCrown is not relying on the information disclosed to prove the central elements of the \noffence. It therefore remains critical that the preconditions set forth in s.  320.31(1)(a) \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n be proven ; this includes “the target value of an alcohol standard that is certified by an \nanalyst”. This also includes the need to prove any corrected target value determined by \nthe qualified technician at the time of testing.  \n[71] As noted by the Court of First Instanc e in Vigneault , in establishing a \nstatutory presumption, Parliament sought to facilitate the presentation of evidence and \nconsiderably reduced an accused’s means of defence at the trial stage. The court further \nnoted that the shortcut provided to the Crown  did not shift the burden of proof \n(para.  36). If anything, the shortcut and the serious consequences that flow from its \napplication make ironclad adherence to the set preconditions all the more important. It \nis for this reason that disclosure alone is ins ufficient and appropriate introduction into \nevidence is required. To hold otherwise would be to condone convictions entered \nwithout giving full effect to the presumption of innocence and without an accused \nhaving had the opportunity to mount a full answer and defence.  \nIV. Application and Conclusion  \n[72] At Mr.  Larocque’s trial, though there were two certificates from analysts \nintroduced into evidence, neither stated the target value of the alcohol standard. \nLikewise, the certificate of the qualified technician conta ined no information about any \ncorrected target value. Given that the Crown failed to prove the target value of the \nalcohol standard, it cannot rely on the presumption in s.  320.31 of the Criminal Code . \n2025 SCC 36 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n [73] I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside Mr.  Larocque’s conviction, \nand enter an acquittal.  \n Appeal dismissed , CÔTÉ J. dissenting . \n Solicitors for the appellant: Guignard Gauvin, Shippagan; The Burke Law \nGroup, Fredericton . \n Solicitor for the respondent: Public Prosecution Service of New \nBrunswick, Fredericton.  \n Solicitor for the interven er Attorney General of Ontario:  Crown Law \nOffice — Criminal , Toronto.  \n Solicitor for the intervener Attorney General of British Columbia: \nCriminal Appeals and Special Prosecutions , Victoria.  \n Solicitor for the interv ener Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Crown \nProsecution Service — Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office , Edmonton.  \n Solicitors for the intervener Criminal Lawyers’ Association  (Ontario) : \nFedorsen Law, Toronto; Addario Law Group, Toronto.  \n2025 SCC",
