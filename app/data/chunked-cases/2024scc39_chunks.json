These agreements ha ve three main objectives: to establish  and \nmaintain an Indigenous police force, Sécurité publique de Mashteuiatsh (“SPM”), \nproviding services adapted to the Indigenous community of Mashteuiatsh; to set the \nmaximum financial contribution by Canada and Quebec to the operation of that police \nforce; and to entrust the management of the force to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. \nThe contracting parties included a clause permitting the renewal of the agreements so \nas to ensure the maintenance of the police force over time.  \n202",

It \nbrought legal proceedings claiming reimbursement of the accumulated deficits from \nthe governments of Canada and Quebec. It rested its claim on two main grounds: a \ncontractual basis under private law, grounded in the provisio ns of the Civil Code of \nQuébec , and a public law basis anchored in the principles of Aboriginal law. According \nto it, Canada and Quebec had refused to genuinely negotiate the funding clauses of the \nagreements, which was a breach of both the requirements of  good faith and the \nobligations — heavier still for the State — flowing from the honour of the Crown.  \n The trial judge dismissed Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s application, \nholding that the contract is the law of the parties and that the honour of the Crown  did \nnot apply. The Court of Appeal set aside that judgment and ordered Canada and Quebec \nto pay their share of the total amount of the accumulated deficits, $832,724.37  for \nCanada and $767,745.58 for Quebec. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the governments’  \nrefusal to fund the SPM justified finding both a violation of the principle of good faith \nand a failure to uphold the honour of the Crown. Only Quebec appealed from the Court \nof Appeal’s decision , Canada having paid the amount  awarded against it by that c ourt. \n Held  (Côté  J. dissenting) : The appeal should be dismissed.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n  Per Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer , Jamal, \nO’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ.: Quebec’s refusal to renegotiate its financial contribution \nwhen the agreements were renewed was not in keeping with the principle of good faith, \na source of private law obligations set out in art.  1375 C.C.Q ., which requ ires parties \nto conduct themselves in good faith in the performance of a contract. It was also a \nbreach of the obligation to act in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown, an \nobligation under public law that Quebec had to fulfill in the performan ce of the \ntripartite agreements. As to the manner in which the breach of the requirements of good \nfaith should be redressed, the record does not make it possible to assess compensatory \ndamages in conformity with the principles of corrective justice. Howeve r, with regard \nto the remedy meant to  restor e the honour of the Crown, which is rooted in \nreconciliatory justice, an award of damages equal to the accumulated deficits is an \nappropriate measure that will enable the contracting parties to undertake future \nnegotiations with equanimity.  \n The first element of the applicable analytical framework to address the \nallegations that the Crown breached its undertakings under the tripartite agreements \ninvolves confirming that the general law of obligations, including th e requirements of \ngood faith, applies to contracts between an Indigenous community and the State. Under \nart. 1376 C.C.Q. , the general rules on obligations apply to the State, to the extent that \nthey are not excluded or altered by other rules of law. The tr ipartite agreements in this \ncase are therefore governed by the general law of obligations, including art.  1375 \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n C.C.Q.  on good faith; Quebec was required to perform its contractual undertakings \ntoward Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan in good faith.  \n Good faith r equires that every contracting party consider the other party’s \ninterests in the performance of the contract, but not that one",

Parties to a contract must conduct themselves loyally by \nnot unduly in creasing the burden on the other party or behaving in an excessive or \nunreasonable manner. This is a duty of conduct that involves making the performance \nof the contract consistent with what was undertaken. After a contract is entered into, \nwhere the parti es have provided through a clause that they will have to enter into \nnegotiations, the obligation to conduct the negotiations in good faith flows directly \nfrom the contract . A breach of good faith in negotiating a renewal contemplated by a \ncontract may thus  be a source of contractual liability . When parties discuss a renewal \nclause, they must negotiate faithfully ; if they begin renewal negotiations pursuant to \nthe very terms of the contract, they are obliged to behave in a manner that is neither \nexcessive no r unreasonable in this final stage of carrying out their agreement. Refusal \nto act in good faith in the negotiation of a renewal contemplated by the parties may \njeopardize the very purpose of the contract where the achievement of that purpose \ndepends on th e existence of a relationship over time.  \n In this case, Quebec had an obligation to act in good faith, including when \nconducting the negotiations contemplated by the tripartite agreements, and it breached \nthat duty. The parties had provided for an extensio n mechanism to facilitate renewal; \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n they therefore had an obligation to carry out any renewal negotiations in good faith. \nThis obligation could not serve to require or impose specific outcomes from the \nnegotiations. Moreover, Quebec had no obligation to ren ew the arrangement for \nanother fiscal year. However, if it sought to do so, the agreements show that renewal \nwould be achieved through negotiation. In such a case, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \nwas not entitled to a specific level of funding, but, by the ter ms of the contract itself, it \ndid have a legitimate expectation that Quebec would consider its perspective in \nnegotiating the extent of its contribution. Quebec’s refusal to discuss an increase in \nfunding constitutes unreasonable conduct contrary to the re quirements of good faith. \nQuebec chose to continue the contractual relationship  while at the same time refusing \nto revisit its financial contribution , even though it knew that the SPM was underfunded. \nThat conduct disregarded the context and its counterpar ty’s interests. B y adopting an \nintransigent position through its refusal to negotiate, Quebec acted contrary to what the \nagreements stipulated and to the binding force of contracts as enshrined in art.  1434 \nC.C.Q . Quebec caused injury to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan by acting in conflict \nwith the expectations raised by the contractual mechanism put in place by the parties \nfor the renewal of the agreements. That conduct was unreasonable because it \nundermined Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s legitimate expectatio ns and disrupted the \nparties’ contractual objective of maintaining the SPM. Quebec should have entered into \ngenuine negotiations with its counterparty and should have listened and shown \nopen ness. The absence of genuine negotiations left Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan in a \nno-win situation: either it continued to impoverish itself to maintain the SPM and \npreserve the progress that the SPM represented in terms of self -government, or it \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n abolished the SPM, which meant both returning to the inadequate services of the Sûreté \ndu Québec and suffering a setback with respect to self -government. Despite the \ndifficulties, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan chose, year after year, to preserve the SPM, \nwhich required it to use its own funds to absorb the annual deficits. The gover nments \nof Canada and Quebec turned a deaf ear to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s requests \nand complaints, and the quality of the SPM’s services suffered as a result.  \n The second element of the framework involves establishing that the \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown also applies to the",

The gover nments \nof Canada and Quebec turned a deaf ear to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s requests \nand complaints, and the quality of the SPM’s services suffered as a result.  \n The second element of the framework involves establishing that the \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown also applies to the performance of Quebec’s \ncontractual undertakings in this case. While art.  1376 C.C.Q.  provides that the private \nlaw of obligations applies to the State, it also specifies that this is subject to any other \nrules of law which  may be applicable to it. This qualification thus refers implicitly to \nthe idea that public common law rules may form a distinct liability regime for the State \nthat supplements the one in  the Civil Code of Québec . The principle of the honour of \nthe Crown i s one such public law rule that may, in some contexts, broaden the scope \nof state liability. However, there is no basis for concluding that the principle of the \nhonour of the Crown is implicitly incorporated into contracts by operation of art.  1434 \nC.C.Q . Consequently, while the honour of the Crown is engaged where the State has \ncontractual obligations, its source, unlike those contractual obligations, is anchored in \npublic law rules.  \n As a common law rule originating in the special relationship between the  \nCrown and Indigenous peoples, the principle of the honour of the Crown is itself \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n anchored to the goal of facilitating the reconciliation of the Crown’s interests with those \nof Indigenous peoples, including by promoting negotiation and the just settlement of \ntheir claims. The honour of the Crown is a constitutional principle that looks forward \nto reconciliation in an ongoing, mutually respectful long -term relationship. Regardless \nof the means used by the Crown to advance the process of reconciliation, the p rinciple \nof the honour of the Crown must be applicable when it is required.  \n Unlike good faith, the honour of the Crown does not apply to the \nperformance of every contract or to every contractual undertaking given by the Crown \nto an Indigenous entity. Inde ed, it applies only in the performance of contracts between \nthe State and Indigenous groups that are intended to foster the modern -day \nreconciliation of pre -existing Indigenous societies with the Crown’s historic assertion \nof sovereignty. The task is there fore to determine the legal test that can be used in this \ncase to identify contractual undertakings that attract the honour of the Crown. First, the \ncontract in question must be entered into by the Crown and an Indigenous group by \nreason and on the basis o f the group’s Indigenous difference. Because the principle of \nthe honour of the Crown rests on the special relationship between the Crown and \nIndigenous peoples, the honour of the Crown is engaged only by an obligation assumed \nby the Crown on the basis of this special relationship, which is different from the one \nit has with the population in general. Second, the contract in question must relate to an \nIndigenous right of self -government, whether the right is established or is the subject \nof a credible claim . It is not necessary, in order for the principle of the honour of the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n \n Crown to apply, that such a right already be recognized by the courts or the Crown. A \ncredible claim is sufficient to impose duties of honourable dealing on the Crown.  \n To ascertain whe ther the tripartite agreements in this case satisfy this test, \nit is necessary to undertake a characterization exercise, through  which the contract at \nissue  is linked  to a normative category that can serve to determine the applicable legal \nregime. The purp ose of characterizing a contract is to identify its legal nature. This \nexercise is not governed strictly by the intention of the parties and is based on the legal \nnature of the act created. It is a question of law. In this case, the characteristic prestati on \nof the tripartite agreements has three aspects. The tripartite agreements provide for the \nestablishment and maintenance of an Indigenous police force, set out a shared funding \nregime between the governments of Canada and Quebec and Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan, and provide for the independent management of the police force by \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. In light of this characteristic prestation, it appears that \nthe parties entered into the tripartite agreements on the basis and by reason of the \nIndigeno us difference of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh",

In light of this characteristic prestation, it appears that \nthe parties entered into the tripartite agreements on the basis and by reason of the \nIndigeno us difference of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh. Only Indigenous communities may \nenter into an agreement with Quebec to establish or maintain an Indigenous police \nforce. Moreover, the tripartite agreements were entered into in the context of the \nnation -to-nation re lationship between Quebec and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, and \nthe aim of the funding is to remedy the historical harm resulting from the imposition of \nthe national police on Indigenous peoples and the difficulties experienced by \nIndigenous communities in managing their internal security.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n  The tripartite agreements also concern the Indigenous right of \nself-government claimed by the Pekuakamiulnuatsh  First Nation in matters of public \nsafety in the community. The establishment and maintenance of Indigenous po lice \nforces that are managed by the communities covered by an agreement and that provide \nculturally appropriate services to those communities distinguish these police forces \nfrom those serving the population in general. It was in the context of the claim b y \nIndigenous peoples to the right of self -government and control over their institutions \nthat Quebec recognized, in the Police Act , the possibility for First Nations to establish \na culturally appropriate police force. The need of Indigenous peoples for suc h police \nservices originates in the difficult, and at times even traumatizing, relationship that \nIndigenous peoples had, and in some cases continue to have, with the police services \nimposed on them over the years by the Crown. The opportunity to enter into  agreements \nwhose objective is to ensure the provision of culturally appropriate police services \nmanaged by the Indigenous communities served therefore contributes to reconciliation.  \n In sum, the tripartite agreements must be characterized as contracts tha t \nengage the honour of the Crown. The fact that the tripartite agreements are not treaties \nprotected by s.  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982  and that Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan is not seeking to establish a right protected by s.  35 of the Constitution A ct, \n1982  makes no difference to the characterization of the contract. Even though the \nparties have agreed that there will be no final resolution of the claims of the \nPekuakamiulnuatsh through the tripartite agreements, the fact remains that these \nagreement s relate to the subject -matter of their claims, that is, the right of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n self-government in matters of internal security. The question is not whether the \nagreement recognizes or modifies Indigenous rights, but only whether it relates to this \nclaimed right.  \n Because it is not a cause of action itself, the principle of the honour of the \nCrown is expressed through the specific obligations to which it gives rise. The content \nof these obligations varies with the circumstances. When the honour of the Crown \napplies to a contract, the Crown must meet a standard of conduct that is higher than in \nthe context of an ordinary contractual relationship and must act in a manner that fosters \nreconciliation. When the Crown decides to enter into a contractual relationship that \nengages its honour, it must negotiate, interpret and apply the contracts with honour and \nintegrity while avoiding even the appearance of sharp dealing. This is an obligation that \nhas long been recognized in the context of treaty making and implementation an d that \ncan be transposed to the contractual context. The Crown must also avoid adopting an \nintransigent attitude. Once an agreement has been entered into, the Crown must conduct \nitself with honour and integrity in performing its obligations. This means, am ong other \nthings, that it must construe the terms of the agreement generously and comply with \nthem scrupulously while avoiding any breach of them. The Crown must also act \nhonourably in any negotiations to change or renew the agreement.  \n In this case, becau se the tripartite agreements contemplated the \nrenegotiation of their funding clauses, the honour of the Crown imposed an obligation \non the Crown to conduct itself honourably during the renewal negotiations.

Quebec did \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n not comply with this obligation. Throu gh its intransigent attitude, it acted \ndishonourably by refusing to negotiate the funding terms of the tripartite agreements. \nQuebec refused to consider Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s repeated requests to \nrenegotiate the level of funding for its police forc e even though it knew that the SPM \nwas underfunded and that Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan would accept an inadequate \nlevel of funding to avoid resorting to the ill -adapted services of the Sûreté du Québec. \nThat conduct represents a breach of the obligation t o perform the tripartite agreements \nwith honour and integrity. The honour of the Crown requires the Crown to \nmeaningfully engage in genuine negotiations in a manner conducive to maintaining a \nrelationship that can support the ongoing process of reconciliat ion. By refusing to \nrenegotiate the level of funding despite Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s repeated \ncomplaints and the precarious situation in which it found itself, Quebec conducted itself \nin a manner that fell well below the standard of honourable conduc t. Through its \nbreach, Quebec jeopardized the contractual equilibrium and the very purpose of the \ntripartite agreements. Quebec thus failed to comply with its obligation to act with \nhonour, establishing a second independent basis of liability.  \n Quebec’s co nduct can therefore be characterized as both a civil fault and a \nbreach of a public law obligation. These two legal regimes differ in nature, and the \nremedies associated with them are grounded in distinct conceptions of justice. The civil \nlaw regime is bas ed on corrective justice, and its aim is to place the aggrieved party in \nthe position it would have been in but for the fault committed. The public law regime \nis concerned instead with the long -term relationship between the Crown and Indigenous \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n communities , and its aim is to restore the honour of the Crown and thereby foster \nreconciliation; this is reconciliatory justice.  \n In the case of the civil law regime and the breach of good faith, once a \nfailure to meet the requirements of good faith has been establi shed, the plaintiff must \nprove the extent of the injury on the basis of the principle of restitutio in integrum , or \nfull restitution. The damages awarded must not exceed the amount necessary to fully \ncompensate for the injury suffered and place the plainti ff in the position it would have \nbeen in but for the breach of good faith. In this case, the Court is unable to carry out \nthis assessment, as it has neither sufficient evidence nor an adequate factual foundation \nto perform this task properly.  \n A remedy mea nt to address the breach of an obligation flowing from the \nhonour of the Crown rest s on a basis other than corrective justice. Reconciliatory justice \nis not intended only to compensate the Indigenous claimant for harm suffered as a result \nof past wrongs; i t serves above all to restore and improve the relationship between the \nCrown and Indigenous peoples. The aim is to impose a measure that places the parties \nback on the path to reconciliation. In this exercise, it is important to be sensitive to \nIndigenous perspectives and to be creative within a principled legal framework. A \nbreach of the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown makes available the \nfull range of remedies, including damages and other coercive relief. The remedy \nrelating to the honour  of the Crown will vary with the circumstances of each case; no \ntype of remedy takes precedence over the others.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n  In this case, the relationship between the parties was undermined by \nQuebec’s intransigent attitude at the stage of renewing the tripartite ag reements.

By imposing a difficult choice on \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan — either continue to impoverish itself to maintain the \nSPM, or abolish the SPM — Quebec did not deal with it on an equal footing and did \nnot act in a spirit of cooperation and respect. This is also part of the damage caused to \nthe relationship, which must now be repaired. In the circumstances, the Court of Appeal \ncould conclude that repairing this damage requires an award of damages. The \nappropriate quantum of damages must be determined through an analysis focused on \nreconciliato ry justice to ensure that the order made will have the effect of restoring the \nhonour of the Crown. The correct amount to be awarded for a breach of an obligation \nflowing from the honour of the Crown is a highly contextual issue. In this case, the \namount d etermined by the Court of Appeal should be upheld given the particular \ncircumstances of the case, and having regard to the purpose of the damages, which \nserve not only to compensate for past injury but also to restore the relationship for the \nfuture.  \n Per Côté  J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial \njudgment should be restored. The principle of good faith and the principle of the honour \nof the Crown do not allow a court to disregard or ignore certain express clauses of a \ncontract and to impose obligations that are inconsistent with their unambiguous terms.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n \n  This case involves a contractual claim for damages in which \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan did not apply to have the agreements annulled or to \nhave certain clauses in the agreements declared abusive . The agreements limit in \nexpress terms the governments’ contribution to a maximum amount determined each \nyear, such that Quebec undertook to contribute financially to the establishment and \nmaintenance of the SPM but did not undertake to pa y all of the costs incurred,  or to \nfund services equal to those provided in communities in the region. Furthermore, \npursuant to the agreements , Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan  is responsible for deficits \nincurred in excess of the financial contribution that th e governments wish to provide \nand the governments are not responsible for undertakings given by Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan. These clauses circumscribe and limit the scope of Quebec’s undertaking.  \n There is agreement with the majority that  the principle of  the honour of the \nCrown is implicitly incorporated into how the contractual undertakings agreed to by \nthe parties must be fulfilled. The tripartite agreements, which provide for the financial \nsupport of Indigenous police services by the governments, are n ot purely commercial \ncontracts. It follows that the principle of the honour of the Crown cannot be ignored in \nthe assessment of Quebec’s conduct in the course of these agreements. Furthermore, \nQuebec’s objective in enacting certain sections of the Police A ct is based on the \nreconciliation of pre -existing Indigenous societies with the assertion of Crown \nsovereignty. Pursuant to art. 1434 C.C.Q. , the public law obligations derived from the \ntripartite agreements in conformity with law are added to the express stipulations of \nthose agreements.  The honour of the Crown and the obligations flowing therefrom are \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n therefore implicitly incorporated into the tripartite agreements by operation of art.  1434 \nC.C.Q . However, that provision does not permit the introduction o f an implied \nobligation that would be inconsistent with the terms of the contract. Obligations that \nmay flow from the principle of the honour of the Crown also cannot be excluded by the \nentire agreement clause stipulated in the agreements.  \n There is disagr eement with the majority, however, concerning the scope of \nthe contractual undertakings agreed to by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan  and Quebec . \nFirst, the government parties did not undertake to pay all of the costs related to the \ncreation and maintenance of a police force that could ensure the same level of service \nas that found in communities in the region. Such an obligation appears nowhere in the \nlanguage of the agreements.

    "text": "amiulnuatsh Takuhikan  and Quebec . \nFirst, the government parties did not undertake to pay all of the costs related to the \ncreation and maintenance of a police force that could ensure the same level of service \nas that found in communities in the region. Such an obligation appears nowhere in the \nlanguage of the agreements. Quebec’s undertaking flows strictly from the tripartite \nagreements given that the p arties expressed their intent to be bound solely by the \nexpress terms of the tripartite agreements by stipulating an entire agreement clause to \nexclude any content external to the contract. This entire agreement clause excludes the \napplication of arts.  1425 and 1434 C.C.Q .  \n Second, Quebec’s undertaking cannot be defined in light of the objectives \nset out in the First Nations Policing Policy (1996)  (“Federal Policy ”) and the First \nNations Policing Program (“FNPP”). The Federal Policy and the FNPP could not bind \nQuebec for three reasons. First, Quebec did not undertake to implement the Federal \nPolicy . Second, the Federal Policy  does not establish binding rules and is therefore not \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n subject to judicial sanction. Third, nowhere in the Federal Policy  is it stated  that the \ngovernments will fund all of the costs of the police services.  \n Lastly, the principle of the honour of the Crown cannot serve as a basis for \nrewriting the terms of the tripartite agreements to introduce into them an obligation for \nQuebec to pay all of the costs related to the creation and maintenance of the SPM. \nThere is therefore disagreement with the majority regarding their conclusions on the \nalleged breaches of contractual good faith and of the principle of the honour of the \nCrown. The majori ty’s analysis expands the purpose of Quebec’s undertaking to \ninclude the obligation to provide services adapted to the community comparable to \nthose of communities in the region even though this objective is nowhere to be found \nin the agreements. This is t antamount to rewriting the terms of these agreements, which \nthe principle of the honour of the Crown cannot be used to do. Such an approach is also \ncontrary to the implied obligations regime in Quebec civil law. An implied obligation \ncan only fill a gap in  the terms of the contract. Article 1434 C.C.Q.  cannot be used to \nfrustrate other provisions of the agreement.  \n With respect to good faith, Quebec fulfilled all of its undertakings and did \nnot abuse any right provided for in the contract, including regard ing the renewal of the \ntripartite agreements. It was not unreasonable for Quebec to rely on the words of the \nagreements concerning the responsibility for the accumulated deficits. There is no \nevidence of any right provided for in the agreements that Quebec  would have abused. \nRegarding the principle of the honour of the Crown, its application to how the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n contractual undertakings must be fulfilled leads to the conclusion that Quebec acted \nhonourably. The government parties proceeded to renew the agreements wit h the \nresources available and further to the appropriations given by Parliament and the \nAssemblée nationale, as contemplated in the agreements.  \n The evidence shows that, throughout their contractual relationship, Quebec \nlistened attentively to its counterp arty’s grievances and was flexible in seeking \nsolutions to the problem of the underfunding of its police force. Quebec provided \nadditional financial support through a variety of measures, particularly to maintain the \nSPM and to contribute to funding the co nstruction of the community’s police station. \nQuebec went beyond what was required by the terms of the agreements by providing \nthese additional amounts to financially support the SPM. This additional financial \nassistance must be taken into account in the a ssessment of Quebec’s conduct with \nrespect to the renewal of the tripartite agreements and with respect to the injury that \nmay have resulted from it. Moreover, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan had financial \nautonomy during the renewal of the agreements. Its con tractual autonomy is \nparticularly reflected in the free and informed choice it made to offer a level of service \nabove the one provided for in the tripartite agreements. Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \nis challenging Quebec’s public policy decisions concerning the giving of financial \nsupport to Indigenous police forces. However, the role of the courts is not to interfere \nin this way in the budget decisions of government parties, which are reflected in the \ntripartite agreements at issue.

The rules of corrective justice under the civil liability \nregime can be adapted to consider the Indigenous perspective and the imperative of \nreconciliation. While the exercise of quant ifying damages may pose additional \ndifficulties for the courts when it comes to remedying a breach of the principle of the \nhonour of the Crown, they are accustomed to using their discretion in determining an \nindemnity that is fair and reasonable. When face d with a largely unforeseeable and \nunquantifiable injury resulting from dishonourable conduct by the Crown, the court \nmay use its discretion to establish a quantum that will take into account restoring the \nhonour of the Crown and be somewhat creative in ex ercising its discretion. This \napproach avoids the trap posed by the highly discretionary nature of the remedy \nanchored in reconciliatory justice in a contractual context. Accepting such a remedial \nscheme could discourage governments from signing these kind s of agreements with \nIndigenous entities.  \nCases Cited  \nBy Kasirer  J. \n Referred to:  Ponce v.

Overview  \n Do obligations undertaken by contract between the Government of Quebec \nand an Indigenous group engage the principles of good faith and of the honour of the \nCrown? If it is found that, in the performance of the contract, Quebec is liable on either \nof these distinct ground s, what remedy should be granted to address the breach? Where \ndamages are claimed, as in this case, the remedy under the private law of obligations \nwill in principle be limited to the amount required to compensate for the injury caused \nto the creditor by t he failure to meet the requirements of good faith. But where there \nhas been a breach of the obligation to act in a manner consistent with the honour of the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n \n Crown, can the public law remedy granted to the Indigenous group be distinguished \nfrom the private l aw remedy with a view to restoring the relationship between the \ncontracting parties, both for the past and for the future, and thus placing them back on \nthe constitutional path to reconciliation? These are the main questions raised by this \nappeal.  \n The cont racts in issue, which concern the police services provided to the \nIndigenous community of Mashteuiatsh in Quebec, are “tripartite” agreements: they \nwere entered into by the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec and \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, an Indigenous band council established under the \nIndian Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-5, which is the respondent in this appeal. These \nagreements have three main objectives: “to establish and maintain” an Indigenous \npolice force that provides services adapted to the  community; to set the maximum \nfinancial contribution by Canada and Quebec to the operation of the force; and to \nentrust the management of the force, which is accompanied by financial responsibility, \nto the respondent. Given the short duration of each of t he agreements, the contracting \nparties have included an extension clause permitting their renewal so as to ensure the \nmaintenance of the police force over time. In addition, the agreements state that they \ndo not serve to recognize Aboriginal or treaty righ ts and that they must not be \ninterpreted to be agreements or treaties within the meaning of s.  35 of the Constitution \nAct, 1982 . \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n \n Between 2013 and 2017 — the period covered by Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan’s amended originating application — the government fu nding provided for \nin the agreements proved to be inadequate on its own to ensure the maintenance of the \nIndigenous police force in Mashteuiatsh. At the end of each fiscal year, the police force \nincurred an operating deficit that did not result from any mi smanagement or \nextraordinary expenses. The respondent therefore brought legal proceedings claiming \nreimbursement of the accumulated deficits from the governments of Canada and \nQuebec [ TRANSLATION ] “[b]ecause of [their] undertaking to pay 100%” of the polic e \nforce’s costs (amended originating application, at para.  84, reproduced in A.R., vol.  I, \nat p. 148).  \n The trial judge dismissed Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s application, \nholding that the contract is the law of the parties and that the honour of the Crown  did \nnot apply. The Court of Appeal set aside that judgment and ordered Canada and Quebec \nto pay their share of the total amount of the accumulated deficits. In the Court of \nAppeal’s view, the governments ’ refusal to fund the Indigenous police force in \nMashteuiatsh justified finding both a violation of the principle of good faith and a \nfailure to uphold the honour of the Crown.  \n Sole appellant before this Court, Quebec refuses to cover any of the deficit. \nIn Quebec’s opinion, contrary to what the Court of Ap peal stated, the honour of the \nCrown does not apply to the agreements",

    "text": " the accumulated deficits. In the Court of \nAppeal’s view, the governments ’ refusal to fund the Indigenous police force in \nMashteuiatsh justified finding both a violation of the principle of good faith and a \nfailure to uphold the honour of the Crown.  \n Sole appellant before this Court, Quebec refuses to cover any of the deficit. \nIn Quebec’s opinion, contrary to what the Court of Ap peal stated, the honour of the \nCrown does not apply to the agreements. They do not contain “solemn promises” and \ndo not deal with the reconciliation of distinctly Indigenous rights or interests with the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n Crown’s assertion of sovereignty. As for the agreemen ts themselves, Quebec \nemphasizes that they set “maximum amounts” for the government contributions and \nthat there is a contractual clause placing responsibility for deficits squarely on the \nshoulders of Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. Citing the binding force of contracts, \nQuebec denies that it has an obligation to make up the difference, given that the \nrespondent has not proved a breach of the contractual terms or of the requirements of \ngood faith. Moreover, Quebec states that it has already provided additiona l assistance \nto the respondent through contract addenda and other means, which would reduce the \nquantum of the damages claimed.  \n The debate therefore centres around the question of whether Quebec is \nresponsible for the deficits resulting from the operation of the Mashteuiatsh police force \nin light of the contractual undertakings set out in the tripartite agreements. \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan rests its claim on two main grounds: a contractual basis \nunder private law, grounded in the provisions of the Civil Code of Québec  (“C.C.Q. ”), \nand a public law basis anchored in the principles of Aboriginal law. According to the \nrespondent, Quebec refused to genuinely negotiate the funding clauses of the \nagreements, which was a breach of both the requirements of good fa ith and the \nobligations — heavier still for the State — flowing from the honour of the Crown. The \nrespondent is not seeking the annulment of the agreements or the recognition of any \nconstitutional right. Rather, it demands reimbursement of the deficits acc umulated \nduring the period at issue. Canada has complied with the Court of Appeal’s order to \npay 52 percent of this amount, its share of the funding under the agreements. As for \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n Quebec, it asks the Court to set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment ordering  that it \npay 48 percent of the deficits, to restore the trial judgment and to dismiss \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s application.  \n This is the setting in which the Court must determine the applicable \nanalytical framework to address allegations that the Crown  has breached its \nundertakings under agreements relating to the establishment and maintenance of an \nIndigenous police force. The parties are asking the Court to clarify how the general law \nof obligations, set out mainly in the Civil Code , applies to contra cts between an \nIndigenous community and the State. This appeal also calls upon us to develop, for the \nfirst time, a methodology for determining whether contractual undertakings given by a \ngovernment to an Indigenous group that are not constitutional in nat ure may be subject \nto the principles of Aboriginal law, and more specifically to the honour of the Crown.  \n Although the two main grounds relied upon — good faith and the honour \nof the Crown — are both principles of public order that may not be derogated fro m by \ncontract, they cannot be conflated because of the distinct bases, in private law and \npublic law, respectively, on which they rest.  \n The first element of the framework proposed here is that the rules of the \ngeneral law of obligations in Book Five of the  Civil Code apply to the State, including \nwhen it enters into any contract with an Indigenous group, subject to any other rules of \nlaw applicable to it (art.  1376 C.C.Q. ). The tripartite agreements are therefore subject \nto the principle, set forth in art.  1375 C.C.Q. , that parties must conduct themselves in \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n good faith in the performance of a contract. Good faith requires that every contracting \nparty consider the other party’s interests in the performance of the contract, but not that \none party subordinate i ts own interests to those of the other in so doing ( Ponce v. \nSociété d’investissements Rhéaume ltée , 2023 SCC 25",

Good faith requires that every contracting \nparty consider the other party’s interests in the performance of the contract, but not that \none party subordinate i ts own interests to those of the other in so doing ( Ponce v. \nSociété d’investissements Rhéaume ltée , 2023 SCC 25, at para.  76; Churchill Falls \n(Labrador) Corp. v. Hydro -Québec , 2018 SCC 46, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 101, at \nparas.  112-13, per Gascon  J., and at para.  177, per Rowe  J., dissenting, but not on this \npoint).  \n In my view, the proper analysis leads to the conclusion that Quebec’s \nrefusal to renegotiate its financial contribution when the agreements were renewed — \neven though it knew that the police force was underfunded and that a return to the \nservices of the Sûreté du Québec (“SQ”) would involve risks for the community — was \nnot in keeping with the requirements of good faith. Quebec’s intransigent behaviour \ndespite the precarious situation of its counterpart y constituted an abuse of right having \nregard to its right to seek the renewal of the agreement, notably through the extension \nclause. In other words, Quebec’s conduct did not constitute a reasonable exercise of its \nright “as expressed by reference to the conduct of a prudent and diligent individual” \n(Houle v. Canadian National Bank , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p.  164; see arts.  6 and 7 \nC.C.Q. ). Quebec’s actions therefore give rise to civil liability under the ordinary rules \nof contract set out in Book Five of the Civil Code . \n A second element of the relevant framework is that the honour of the \nCrown is a public law principle originating in the special relationship with Indigenous \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n peoples and that it applies to the performance of Quebec’s contractual undertakings in \nthis case. While art.  1376 C.C.Q.  provides that the private law of obligations applies to \nthe State, it also specifies that this is “subject to any other rules of law which may be \napplicable to [it]”. This qualification set out in art.  1376 C.C.Q.  refers implicitly to the \nidea that “public common law” rules may form a distinct liability regime for the State \nthat supplements the one in Book Five of the Civil Code  (Prud’homme v. Prud’homme , \n2002 SCC 85, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 663, at para.  46; see also Sharp v. Autorité des marchés \nfinanciers , 2023 SCC 29, at para.  58, per Wagner  C.J. and Jamal  J., and at para.  150, \nper Côté  J., dissenting, but not on this point). These public common law rules can, of \ncourse, narrow the scope of the State’s liability, as immunities do, but they can also \nalter it in other ways, and even intensify it.  \n The principle of the honour of the Crown, which imposes a high s tandard \nof conduct on the State, is one such public law rule that may, in some contexts, broaden \nthe scope of state liability. Unlike good faith, the honour of the Crown does not apply \nto the performance of every contract and is not an implied contractual obligation. As a \ncommon law rule originating in the sui generis  relationship between the Crown and \nIndigenous peoples, the principle of the honour of the Crown is itself anchored to the \ngoal of reconciliation. Indeed, it applies only in the performance of contracts between \nthe State and Indigenous groups that are intended to foster the modern -day \nreconciliation of pre -existing Indigenous societies with the Crown’s historic assertion \nof sovereignty (see R. v. Desautel , 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at pa ra. 22). \nOnce its application is established, the binding nature of the honour of the Crown is, it \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n seems to me, certain: as Binnie  J. wrote in the context of a treaty, “the Crown cannot \ncontract out of its duty of honourable dealing with Aboriginal people”  (Beckman v.",

This Court has never yet settled \nthe question of whether there is a right of self -government protected by s.  35(1) of the \nConstitution Act, 1982 . However, as the case law on the duty to consult shows, the \nhonour of the Crown may give rise to duties for the State, even where there is no \nestablished right protected by s.  35(1) (see Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister \nof Forests) , 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at para.  35). Regardless of the means \nused by the Crown to advance the process of recon ciliation, whether it be negotiating \ntreaties, drafting legislation or entering into a contract as in the present case, the \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown must be applicable when it is required, and in \naccordance with the terms of the instrument that  engages it.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n \n In the circumstances of this case, Quebec and Canada, as contracting \nparties, have an obligation to act with honour and integrity toward Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan in the performance of the tripartite agreements. These agreements are \nintended  to advance reconciliation through the establishment and maintenance of an \nIndigenous police force that offers culturally appropriate services whose quality is in \nline with the applicable standard for such services, and for which administrative \nresponsibil ity is entrusted to an Indigenous entity. The agreements relate to a credible, \nalbeit not yet established, claim to the right of self -government in matters of policing. \nAs noted by the Minister who introduced the bill that authorized entering into such \nagreements in 1995 in the National Assembly, the establishment and maintenance of \npolice forces managed by Indigenous peoples are part of a process [ TRANSLATION ] \n“assuring them the exercise of the right of self -government in Quebec” ( Journal des \ndébats , vol.  34, No.  19, 1st Sess., 35th Leg., January  27, 1995, at p.  1252 (S.  Ménard)).  \n Because the tripartite agreements provided for the renegotiation of their \nfunding clauses, the Crown was required to conduct itself honourably during the \nrenewal negotiations. Que bec’s obstinate refusal to genuinely renegotiate the contract’s \nfunding terms is not only a breach of the requirements of good faith but also a breach \nof the obligation to act in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown, a principle \nof public law b ased on a higher standard than the one relating to the obligation of good \nfaith under private law. It bears repeating that these are two distinct bases. As I will \nendeavour to show, the breach of an obligation flowing from the honour of the Crown \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n alone, in dependently of the breach of the requirements of good faith, justifies holding \nQuebec liable.  \n As to the manner in which these breaches should be redressed, the \nappropriate remedy associated with the obligation of good faith",

As I will \nendeavour to show, the breach of an obligation flowing from the honour of the Crown \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n alone, in dependently of the breach of the requirements of good faith, justifies holding \nQuebec liable.  \n As to the manner in which these breaches should be redressed, the \nappropriate remedy associated with the obligation of good faith under the civil law \nmust be dist inguished from that associated with the honour of the Crown under public \nlaw. Like the distinct bases of liability to which they refer, these private law and public \nlaw remedies are grounded in distinct conceptions of justice — corrective  justice for \nthe b reach of the obligation of good faith under general contract law and justice linked \nto reconciliation  for the failure to uphold the honour of the Crown, a public common \nlaw principle whose foundation lies outside Book Five of the Civil Code . \n Once a breach of the requirements of good faith has been established, the \nplaintiff still bears the burden of proving the extent of the injury caused to it by the \ndefendant’s wrongful conduct in accordance with the basic rules of the law of civil \nliability grounded in t he principle of restitutio in integrum , or full restitution. Here, the \ndamages owed were not assessed at trial, because the judge did not find any fault on \nthe part of the governments of Canada and Quebec. In my view, a precise calculation \nof damages, in c onformity with the principles of corrective justice, must be undertaken. \nThe damages awarded must not exceed the amount necessary to fully compensate for \nthe injury suffered and place Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan in the position it would \nhave been in but fo r the breach of good faith by the governments of Canada and Quebec \nin the renegotiation of the agreements (see arts.  1611 et seq. C.C.Q. ). However, in this \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n case we have neither sufficient evidence nor an adequate factual foundation to perform \nthis task pro perly, and particularly to determine the relevance of the contract addenda \nand other additional contributions that Quebec contends are relevant to the assessment \nof damages. Had there been no claim based on the principle of the honour of the Crown, \nI would  therefore have proposed remanding the case to the Superior Court for an \nassessment of compensatory damages, pursuant to s.  46.1 of the Supreme Court Act , \nR.S.C. 1985, c.  S-26. \n However, given the distinct public law basis for Quebec’s liability, a \nremedy m eant to address the breach of the Crown’s obligation to carry out the \nagreements in an honourable manner rests on a basis other than corrective justice. \nRooted in what might be described as reconciliatory justice, this remedy is not intended \nto compensate the Indigenous claimant only for harm suffered as a result of past \nwrongs. It serves here above all to restore and improve the relationship between the \nCrown and Indigenous peoples in order to support reconciliation, a process that not \nonly takes the past into account but also “continues beyond formal claims resolution” \n(Haida Nation , at para.  32). In the determination of an appropriate remedy to preserve \nthe honour of the Crown, Jamal  J., writing for the Court, recently noted the importance \nof being “creat ive” within a principled legal framework ( Ontario (Attorney General) v. \nRestoule , 2024 SCC 27, at para.  277, quoting P.  W. Hogg and L.  Dougan, “The Honour \nof the Crown: Reshaping Canada’s Constitutional Law” (2016), 72 S.C.L.R.  (2d) 291, \nat p. 292). In thi s case, I am of the view that an award of damages equal to the deficits \nindicated by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan is an appropriate measure that will enable \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n the contracting parties to undertake future negotiations with equanimity. It also seems \nto me that r emanding the case to the Superior Court would be contrary to considerations \nof proportionality, which warrant special attention where an obligation flowing from \nthe honour of the Crown has been breached.  \n I would therefore dismiss the appeal, with costs.

These agreements are \nfor the establishment and maintenance of an Indigenous police force providing \nculturally appropriate services to the commu nity, Sécurité publique de Mashteuiatsh \n(“SPM”).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n \n \n Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan is the respondent in these proceedings. \nAlthough both Canada and Quebec were defendants at trial and respondents on appeal, \nonly the Attorney General of Quebec is appealing from t he Court of Appeal’s decision. \nHaving paid the amount awarded against it by that court, Canada is taking part in the \nappeal only as an intervener.  \nB. Policing in Indigenous Communities  \n Historically, policing in Indigenous communities in Canada was \ncharacteriz ed first and foremost by the mistrust that these communities felt toward \nnon-Indigenous police forces. As stated in the Final report  of the Public Inquiry \nCommission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services in \nQuébec  chaired by the Hon. Jacques Viens (2019) (“Viens Commission”), that mistrust \nreflects the intergenerational trauma resulting from the implementation of the former \npolicy of assimilation:  \n . . . during the period when the newly formed dominion of Canada wa s \nshaping its identity, the Indigenous peoples’ ways of life were being \nradically transformed. For example, under a wide range of new legislation, \nFirst Nations members were confined to reserves, limited in exercising \ntheir hunting and fishing rights, forc ed to renounce their language and \nspirituality, and cohabit with private companies (forestry, mining, etc.) that \ngradually made inroads into their territory. In that context, police officers, \nwho had the authority to apply the legislation, quickly became s ymbols of \nrepression. The rest of the story, including residential schools and police \nintervention making it possible to forcibly remove children from their \nfamilies, crystallized that perception and fuelled a profound sense of \nmistrust. [p.  257] \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n \n Quoting a nd adopting one participant’s comments, the Viens Commission \nreported that, over the years, “that mistrust and repression generated various crisis \nsituations that further amplified the tensions between Indigenous peoples and the \ngeneral population, includi ng police forces” (pp.  257-58). Those crisis situations \nincluded, in particular, the “Salmon war” episode in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the \nOka crisis a decade later and the events in Val -d’Or, in which the mistreatment of \nIndigenous women by officers  of the SQ came to light in 2015 (pp.  11 and 258).  \n Another important feature of policing in these communities is the \nunderfunding of Indigenous police forces, “a major, long -documented problem” (Viens \nCommission, at p.  267). Underfunding compromises the qu ality of policing as it affects \nthe number of police officers, their salaries, their recruitment, the equipment available \nto them (which may be “obsolete or simply inadequate” (p.  271)), police facilities and \nthe services provided. In some cases, underfund ing can lead to a situation that \n“endangers personal safety” (p.  271). This observation is made even more forcefully in \na 2010 report, quoted by the Court of Appeal, which stated that [ TRANSLATION ] “the \nsafety of First Nations is compromised by a lack of r es",

Framework for Entering Into an d Implementing Tripartite Agreements  \n(1) Federal Framework  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n \n In 1986, Canada established the Task Force on Policing on Reserves . In its \nfinal report published in 1990, that task force explained that Indigenous communities \nin Canada did not have access to the sam e level and quality of police services as other \ncommunities ( Indian Policing Policy Review: Task Force Report ). It called upon the \nfederal and provincial governments to work together more cooperatively to provide \nquality police services to Indigenous popul ations and further advance Indigenous \nself-government in matters of public safety. It urged Canada to develop a cohesive \npolicy based, among other things, on the principle that Indigenous communities “are \nentitled to the same level and quality of policing services as other similarly situated \ncommunities in the region” (p.  22). \n In 1991, in the wake of that report, Canada adopted the First Nations \nPolicing Policy  (“Policy ”) to “provide First Nations across Canada with access to \npolice services that are profes sional, effective, culturally appropriate, and accountable \nto the communities they serve” (p.  1). The Policy  states that, to this end, “the federal \ngovernment, provincial and territorial governments and First Nations work together to \nnegotiate tripartite a greements for police services that meet the particular needs of each \ncommunity” ( ibid.). The Policy  clearly specifies that it is “a practical means to support \nthe federal policy on the implementation of the inherent right and the negotiation of \nself-govern ment” (p.  2; see also pp.  1 and 3). It also states that the policing services so \nprovided should be “equal in quality and level of service to policing services found in \ncommunities with similar conditions in the region” (p.  4). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n \n With regard to funding, the Policy  states that “[t]he federal and provincial \ngovernments, because they share jurisdiction, should share .  . . the government \ncontribution toward the cost of First Nations policing services” (pp.  5-6). The federal \ngovernment pays 52 percent of the contr ibution, and the provincial or territorial \ngovernment pays 48 percent (p.  6). In addition, it says “First Nations communities will, \nwhere possible, be encouraged to help pay for the cost of maintaining their police \nservice, particularly for enhanced servic es” ( ibid.). Under the Policy , these costs are \ncalculated on the basis of costs “for policing arrangements in other communities with \nsimilar conditions in the region” (p.  7). \n The Policy  is implemented through the First Nations Policing Program  \n(“FNPP”), wh ich is itself governed by the Terms and Conditions for Contribution \nFunding Under the First Nations Policing Program , December  9, 2015 (online) \n(“Terms and Conditions ”). \n(2) Quebec Framework  \n After the Government of Canada adopted the Policy , the Government of \nQuebec tabled Bill 57 in order to include provisions in the Police Act , R.S.Q., c.  P-13, \nauthorizing it to enter into agreements with Indigenous communities to establish or \nmaintain police forces (see An Act to amend the Police Act and the Act respecting police \norganization as regards Native police , S.Q. 1995, c.  12). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n \n The Police Act  was thus amended to add s.  79.0.1.

That section provided \nthat “[t]he Government may enter into an agreement with a Native community \nrepresented by its counci l to establish or maintain a police force in a territory \ndetermined under the agreement”, and specified that “[a] police force thus established \nor maintained shall, for the duration of the agreement, be a police force for the purposes \nof this Act.”  \n In 2000 , the provisions on Indigenous police forces were incorporated, \nwith minor amendments, into the Police Act , CQLR, c.  P-13.1 (“ Act”). Section 79.0.1 \nof the former Police Act  became s.  90 of the Act. \n The Act provides that the SQ is required to provide level  6 police services, \nthe highest level, throughout Quebec (ss.  50 and 70, and Sch.  G). In particular, the SQ \nmust provide all levels of police services that are not or cannot be provided by \nmunicipal police forces, in collaboration with those forces (ss.  50, 70 and 79).  \n With respect to Indigenous police forces, at the relevant time, s.  90 of the \nAct provided that “[t]he Government may enter into an agreement with one or more \nNative communities, each represented by its band council, to establish or maintain a \npolice force in a territory determined under the agreement.” In this regard, it should be \nnoted that the use of the permissive word “may” clearly indicates that s.  90 authorized \nthe State to enter into such agreements but did not impose an obligation on it  to do so. \nThat section, like the one it succeeded, specified that a police force “thus established \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n or maintained shall, for the duration of the agreement, be a police force for the purposes \nof this Act”.  \n At the relevant time, the Act gave each Indigenous police force the mission \nof “maintaining peace, order and public safety in the territory for which it is established, \npreventing and repressing crime and offences under the laws and regulations applicable \nin that territory and seeking out offenders” (s.  93). The congruence between that \nmission and the one assigned to all police forces by s.  48 of the Act suggests that \nIndigenous police forces established under the Act must provide services that are \nsimilar in quality to those provided to other communities, even if they are not required \nto provide all the same services (s.  72 para.  3). \n Indigenous communities that do not enter into an agreement with Quebec \nor that decide  to abolish their police force are served by the SQ, at no cost, pursuant to \nits mandate as a national police force.  \n(3) Implementation of the Agreements  \n In 1996, a first tripartite agreement for the establishment and maintenance \nof the SPM was concluded by Ca nada, Quebec and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. \nThereafter, successive agreements were entered into, without interruption, to ensure the \nmaintenance of the SPM. During the period at issue (2013 to 2017), the agreements \nwere annual until 2015 -2016, after whic h an addendum was signed extending the last \nagreement by two years.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n \n Under the agreements, which are all similar and whose content will be \nexamined in detail below, Canada and Quebec make a financial contribution that is \ncapped at a “maximum amount”. The re spondent is responsible for the administrative \nmanagement of the SPM and for any deficits incurred. From 2013 to 2017, it had to \nassume deficits totalling $1,599,469.95. More specifically, the deficits were \n$214,288.08 in 2013 -2014, $1,225,336.87 in 2014 -2015, $137,629 in 2015 -2016 and \n$22,216 in 2016 -2017.  \n On July  17, 2014, an arbitration award was issued against \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan (A.R., vol.

That assistance is largely documented in \nExhibit DPGQ -21, a table that Quebec filed with the court four days before the h earing \n(A.R., vol.  XIV, at p.  132).  \n For example, in 2006, Quebec undertook to pay a maximum of $743,208 \nto help Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan relocate its police station. That amount \nrepresented 48 percent of the costs, with the remainder being funded by the  respondent. \nDuring the period at issue, Quebec also undertook to pay it $125,000 in connection \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n with its participation in the Prévention jeunesse funding program, in addition to \nauthorizing the secondment of SQ managerial officers to the SPM. Further, in 2 014, \nCanada and Quebec agreed to give the respondent, on an exceptional basis, an \nadditional maximum of $284,514, of which they were to pay 52 percent and 48 percent, \nrespectively. Finally, in 2016, the respondent entered into two bilateral agreements with  \nCanada and Quebec under which they undertook to pay it an additional maximum of \n$400,000 each to ensure the maintenance of the SPM.  \n More recently, in the spring of 2018, the parties conducted negotiations \nthat led to a funding offer that [ TRANSLATION ] “represents a significant increase of just \nover 35% from the funding paid in 2017 -2018 under [the former] tripartite agreement” \n(R.R., at p.  343).  \nD. 2004 Agreement in Principle to Enter Into a Treaty  \n In 2004, in pursuit of achieving self -government, Pekuakamiul nuatsh \nTakuhikan reached an agreement in principle with Canada and Quebec (reproduced in \nR.R., at p.  72)1 to enter into a treaty within the meaning of ss.  25 and 35 of the \nConstitution Act, 1982 . The agreement in principle states, in particular, that \nself-government “is included among the aboriginal rights of the First Nations” \n(s. 3.3.3). It also provides that “[t]he legislative assemblies of the First Nations may \nenact laws to constitute, maintain and organize police corps” (s.  9.4.1).

It says that the undertaking by Canada and \nQuebec to “pay 100%” of the funding for the SPM justifies requiring the \nreimbursement of the full amount  of the deficits incurred during that period, \n$1,599,469.95 (AOA, at paras.  83-84). \n In support of its application, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan alleges that \nCanada and Quebec [ TRANSLATION ] “breached their obligations to negotiate in good \nfaith, act with hon our and discharge their fiduciary duties to the .  . . First Nation for the \nmaintenance and funding of police services for the Mashteuiatsh territory” (AOA, at \npara.  11). In particular, it argues that the wording and content of the agreements \n[TRANSLATION ] “were imposed” on it in a context where it had no “real bargaining \npower” and no real alternative (para.  33). Furthermore, Canada and Quebec \n[TRANSLATION ] “renewed and concluded the Tripartite Agreements with impunity, \nknowing that the budgets and funding provided for in them [did] not correspond to the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n actual costs of police services in Mashteuiatsh, without taking any action whatsoever \nwith respect to these budget variances” (para.  57). \n In defence, Canada and Quebec deny any breach of their obligations an d \ndeny any liability for the accumulated deficits.  \n Echoing Canada’s arguments, Quebec acknowledges that the province \nknew that the budgets and funding provided for in the tripartite agreements did not \ncorrespond to the actual costs of police services in Ma shteuiatsh. However, Quebec \ndenies that it imposed the agreements on Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, that it set the \nlevel of its financial contribution unilaterally and arbitrarily or that it undertook to fully \nfund the SPM together with Canada. Quebec also denies any bad faith. In this regard, \nit notes that its representatives [ TRANSLATION ] “listened to the [respondent’s] \ngrievances, discussed matters honestly and acted to the extent of their authority”, and \nalso agreed to a number of the respondent’s reques ts, paying it additional amounts on \nseveral occasions (A.R., vol.  I, at p. 176, para.  81). Quebec therefore states that it \nfulfilled its contractual obligations. It submits that Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan made \nthe decision to renew the agreements in extre mis year after year and cannot accuse \nQuebec of placing it in a precarious position with respect to concluding them. Quebec \nalso disputes the amount claimed as an accumulated deficit, saying that it is \n[TRANSLATION ] “not reconcilable” with the respondent’s  financial statements \n(para.  101). With regard to the public law remedies, Quebec argues that it did not owe \nany fiduciary obligation or any obligation flowing from the honour of the Crown to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. In the alternative, Quebec maintain s that it always \nacted with honour in its dealings with Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan.  \nIII. Judicial History  \nA. Quebec Superior Court, 2019 QCCS 5699 (Dufresne  J.) \n Before trial, Bouchard  J. of the Superior Court dismissed the exceptions to \ndismiss raised by Canada a nd Quebec, explaining that the action raised new questions \nof law relating to the honour of the Crown that the court could not decide without \nevidence being presented. The judge also said evidence was required to consider \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s argu ment that it had accepted the tripartite \nagreements without having any real choice (see 2017 QCCS 4787, at paras.  41 et seq.).  \n Ruling on the merits, the trial judge (Dufresne  J.) dismissed the claim, \nrejecting the allegations that Canada and Quebec were in  breach of good faith, the \nobligations flowing from the honour of the Crown or any fiduciary obligation.  \n The trial judge allowed the",

He decided that the contested exhibits, which provided general information \nabout the relationship between non -Indigenous police forces and Indigenous \ncommunities, were not relevant to the issues (para.  53). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n \n Beginning his analysis with an overview of the general principles of the \nlaw of obligations, the trial judge the n noted in particular that good faith applies \n[TRANSLATION ] “at every stage in the negotiation, performance and termination of a \ncontract” (para.  55). With regard to the terms of the agreements, the judge found that \nthe entire agreement clause prohibited d efining the funded level of service on the basis \nof the FNPP. He noted that other clauses provided that the financial contributions of \nCanada and Quebec were “maximum amounts” and that Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan was responsible for any deficits incurred i n the administration of the police \nforce. This led him to reject the allegation that the federal and provincial governments \nhad breached the obligation to [ TRANSLATION ] “pay 100%” of the SPM’s costs \n(para.  61, quoting AOA, at para.  84). \n In the judge’s view , Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan had freely bound itself \nknowing that the funding offered by the governments of Canada and Quebec was \ninadequate. He also found that the evidence [ TRANSLATION ] “does not support the \nallegations of bad faith”, noting that “[r]at her, there was transparency in each \ncommunication” (para.  72). \n Returning to the public law grounds for the action, the judge began by \nrejecting the idea that the agreements gave rise to fiduciary obligations, explaining, \namong other things, that Pekuakamiu lnuatsh Takuhikan had not identified any specific \ncollective Indigenous interest in respect of which Canada and Quebec had exercised \ndiscretion. He held that the honour of the Crown did not entail any obligation for \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n Canada and Quebec in this case, as this principle can create obligations only in limited \ncontexts arising from s.  35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . \n Having rejected good faith, fiduciary obligations and the honour of the \nCrown as bases for the claim, the judge concluded his reasons by giving [ TRA NSLATION ] \n“full effect to the tripartite agreements” and dismissing the plaintiff’s action (para.  88). \nHad he held otherwise, he would have subtracted $400,000 from the award against \nQuebec because of the supplemental assistance in the same amount that Que bec had \nprovided to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan in 2016 to ensure the maintenance of the \nSPM.  \nB. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 1699 (Bich, Bouchard and Ruel  JJ.A.)  \n The Court of Appeal allowed Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s appeal, \nholding that the judge ha d erred in his analysis of both the private law and the public \nlaw grounds raised in the amended originating application. The Court of Appeal set \naside the trial judgment and ordered the governments of Canada and Quebec, \nrespectively, to pay Pekuakamiulnua tsh Takuhikan $832,724.37 and $767,745.58, \namounts corresponding to the accumulated deficits, along with interest at the legal rate \nand the additional indemnity.

Concurring  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n \n Bouchard  J.A. held that the trial judge had erred in allowing the objection \nto the evidence on the basis that the contested exhibits were not relevant to the case. \nReferring in particular to the ina dequacy of the funding for Indigenous police forces \nand the legitimate mistrust felt by Indigenous communities toward non -Indigenous \npolice forces, he noted that the exhibits’ [ TRANSLATION ] “purpose .  . . was .  . . to \nprovide context for” Pekuakamiulnuatsh  Takuhikan’s allegation that the governments \nof Canada and Quebec had breached their constitutional obligations (para.  64). In this \nsense, the exhibits were relevant to the analysis of liability.  \n Bouchard  J.A. then found that the honour of the Crown was en gaged in this \ncase, and accordingly decided that it was unnecessary to determine whether Canada \nand Quebec also had fiduciary obligations. In his view, the governments — Canada, by \nadopting its Policy , and Quebec, by agreeing to participate in the FNPP — \n[TRANSLATION ] “solemnly undertook to fund [Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s] police \nservices at a level comparable to that of ‘communities with similar conditions in the \nregion’”, a commitment that reflected “the objective of supporting First Nations in \nacquir ing the tools to become self -sufficient and self -governing, one of the purposes of \ns. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 ” (para.  74). The trial judge had therefore erred in \nconfining himself to the text of the agreements to adjudicate the dispute.  \n Bouchard  J.A. considered Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s argument that \nthe governments of Canada and Quebec had not acted with honour because they had \n[TRANSLATION ] “maintained and renewed” the agreements on the basis of budgets that \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n were arbitrary and inadequate (par a. 80). Bouchard  J.A. concluded that the \ngovernments of Canada and Quebec were required to fund the police force \n[TRANSLATION ] “in a manner that would allow for the same quality of service as that \nprovided to non -Indigenous communities” (para.  118). By not  doing so, they had \ncreated an impossible dilemma for Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, namely choosing \nbetween the SQ’s poorly adapted but free services and the SPM’s appropriately adapted \nbut underfunded services of lower quality. Bouchard  J.A. characterized that \ngovernment conduct as dishonourable, finding that the governments had turned \n[TRANSLATION ] “a deaf ear to the grievances” of Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \n(para.  124). He therefore proposed to order Canada and Quebec to pay the amounts \ncorresponding to their share of the deficits claimed.  \n(2) Bich  J.A., Bouchard and Ruel  JJ.A. Concurring  \n Agreeing [ TRANSLATION ] “unreservedly” with Bouchard  J.A.’s reasons \n(para.  126), Bich  J.A. wrote reasons in which she explained that, under the private law \nof obligations, he r colleague’s demonstration led to a finding of abuse of contractual \nrights.  \n Bich  J.A. found that the duties flowing from the honour of the Crown, a \nconstitutional principle, apply to the State under art.  1376 C.C.Q.  These duties, which \nhave the force of l aw, form part of the obligational content of the agreements pursuant \nto art.  1434 C.C.Q.  She was of the view that [ TRANSLATION ] “when the state contracts \nwith an Indigenous person or entity, it must, in all aspects, do so in a manner that \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n respects the hono ur of the Crown”, such that the State is held “to a standard of conduct, \nwithin the meaning of arts.  6, 7 and 1375 C.C.Q. , that is higher than that of ordinary \ncontracting parties” (para.  130).

This constitutional principle, she wrote, \n[TRANSLATION ] “is en trenched in its contractual obligations” ( ibid.). Contractual \nconduct that does not comply with this constitutional obligation [ TRANSLATION ] \n“therefore opens the door to a finding of civil abuse” ( ibid.). \n The conduct identified by Bouchard  J.A. led to such  a finding of abuse \n[TRANSLATION ] “by holding [Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan] captive in a contractual \nrelationship which is financially unsustainable” (para.  131). The governments of \nCanada and Quebec committed an abuse of right, within the meaning of arts.  6 and 7 \nC.C.Q. , [TRANSLATION ] “resulting from the violation of their obligation to act \nhonourably, an obligation that forms part of the contractual agreements at issue” \n(para.  138). In particular, they engaged in [ TRANSLATION ] “contractual conduct that is \nobjectively unreasonable” by creating false expectations or being indifferent to their \ncounterparty’s interests (para.  139).  \n Bich  J.A. concluded that the deficits were an appropriate reflection of the \nharm resulting from that abuse. An award of damages corresponding to the deficits \nincurred by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan in the administration of the SPM would be \n[TRANSLATION ] “a fair and reasonable remedy” (para.  140).  \nIV. Parties’ Arguments and Issues on Appeal  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n \n The arguments raise d by the parties all concern the scope of Quebec’s \nobligations and the manner in which its contractual undertakings were performed.  \n Quebec submits that the trial judge’s interpretation of the tripartite \nagreements is correct and is entitled to deference on  appeal. The undertaking made by \nthe governments of Canada and Quebec was always to fund the SPM in accordance \nwith the terms of the agreements, not to provide [ TRANSLATION ] “100 percent” of the \nfunding (transcript, day 1, at pp.  20, 23 and 38; see also A. F., at paras.  58 and 98). \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan takes the view that their undertaking was not limited to \npaying the amounts specified in the agreements, but was rather [ TRANSLATION ] “to \nestablish and maintain a professional, effective and culturally appropriate Indigenous \npolice force” (R.F., at para.  43; see also para.  86). \n With respect to contractual civil liability, Quebec acknowledges that it was \nrequired to perform its undertakings in good faith, as such an obligation attaches to \nevery contract. However, Quebec argues that the trial judge held that it did not breach \nthe duties flowing from this obligation and, here again, there is no reviewable error in \nthat factual determination. In its opinion, the Court of Appeal erred in relying on the \nfederal  Policy , in not showing deference to the trial judge’s conclusion that Quebec \nacted in good faith and in finding an abuse of right without identifying the right that \nQuebec had supposedly abused. Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, for its part, adopts \nBich  J.A.’ s analysis to the effect that Quebec’s conduct, which reflected indifference \nto the Indigenous community’s interests, was wrongful and constituted an abuse of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n right. The respondent states that despite the precariousness of the funding — of which \nthe govern ments of Canada and Quebec were well aware — the renewal process for \nthe tripartite agreements left no room for negotiation. The governments’ flat refusal to \nnegotiate presented the respondent with a [ TRANSLATION ] “false choice”: either it \nagreed to a rene wal without any possibility of negotiation, sinking even further into \ndeficit, or it gave up on maintaining the SPM and relied on the SQ’s ill -adapted services \n(R.F., at para.  99 (emphasis deleted)).  \n With respect to the public law basis for the claim, Queb ec argues that it \nbreached no obligation incumbent",

It submits that the tripartite agreements did \nnot give rise to any obligation flowing from the honour the Crown or to any fiduciary \nobligation. Quebec reiterates its request to exclude exhibits on  which the Court of \nAppeal relied in this regard, renewing its argument that they are not relevant to the \ncase. More specifically, it adds, the honour of the Crown is engaged only in situations \nthat relate to rights or interests specific to Indigenous peop les, where it is a matter of \nreconciling the pre -existence of Indigenous societies with the Crown’s assertion of \nsovereignty, which is not the case here. In the alternative, if the honour of the Crown \napplies, Quebec argues that it discharged the obligatio ns flowing from it.  \n Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan counters on this point that, in the \nperformance of the contractual undertakings, Quebec had obligations flowing from the \nhonour of the Crown as well as fiduciary obligations. In particular, it argues that \nQuebec, which presented it with unilateral and arbitrary funding offers that left no room \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n for genuine negotiations and that failed to take the SPM’s actual costs into account, did \nnot act with honour and integrity when it came time to renew the agreements. In  so \ndoing, Quebec, which wanted to ensure the maintenance of the SPM, forced it to bear \na significant portion of its costs while benefiting from the sums allocated by the federal \ngovernment to the FNPP. This was dishonourable conduct.  \n Turning to the questi on of remedy, Quebec acknowledges that, if it \ncommitted a contractual fault, an award of damages may be an appropriate remedy. \nHowever, it maintains that the Court of Appeal [ TRANSLATION ] “acted arbitrarily” in \nsetting the quantum of damages at the value o f the accumulated deficits “without \nfurther explanation” (A.F., at para.  127). Quebec therefore takes the view that if the \norder to pay damages is upheld, the case should be remanded to the Superior Court so \nthat it can fix the quantum in accordance with t he applicable principles and in light of \nall the evidence, including the contract addenda and the additional financial \ncontributions provided by Quebec. In Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s opinion, both \nthe rules of public law and those of the civil law [ TRAN SLATION ] “justify the \nreimbursement of the deficits” accumulated, and Quebec must pay its share, 48 percent, \nas the Court of Appeal held (R.F., at para.  149). This Court should therefore dismiss \nthe appeal, it says, rather than remanding the case to the Su perior Court.  \n The respondent brought a motion to adduce new evidence, specifically a \ndocument entitled Report 3 — First Nations and Inuit Policing Program: Independent \nAuditor’s Report  (Office of the Auditor General of Canada (2024)). According to the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n respondent, this evidence provides context for its constitutional arguments by \nhighlighting the shortcomings of the federal Policy . The motion, which was referred to \nthe panel by a judge of the Court, is contested by Quebec, which disputes the relevance \nof the  evidence.  \n In light of these arguments, it is appropriate to begin by clearly identifying \nthe contractual undertakings of Quebec set out in the tripartite agreements in effect \nduring the period at issue. We then proceed to answer the two main questions tha t shape \nthe debate before this Court:  \nA. In performing the contractual undertakings it made to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, did Quebec breach (i)  the \nrequirements of good faith or (ii)  the obligations flowing from \nthe honour of the Crown, if it applies?  \nB. If so, what is the appropriate remedy for each of these \nbreaches?  \n I would note that the Crown’s liability under a contract entered into with \nan Indigenous entity and governed by the common law in Canada would be analyzed \nusing this same approach involving two  distinct grounds for liability that are \nindependent",

If so, what is the appropriate remedy for each of these \nbreaches?  \n I would note that the Crown’s liability under a contract entered into with \nan Indigenous entity and governed by the common law in Canada would be analyzed \nusing this same approach involving two  distinct grounds for liability that are \nindependent of each other, that is, liability under private law and liability under public \nlaw. Of course, the private law analysis of the requirements of good faith in the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n performance of such a contract would be go verned by the relevant common law \nprinciples (see, in particular, Bhasin v. Hrynew , 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, at \nparas.  65-66). By contrast, since the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown \nare anchored in public law, the analysis of the Crown’s liability under this second \ndistinct branch would proceed similarly to that set out in this case: “There is but one \nhonour to which the Crown is bound .  . .” (R.  Mainville, An Overview of Aboriginal \nand Treaty Rights and Compensation for Their Brea ch (2001), at p.  115).  \nV. Analysis  \nIntroduction : Contractual Undertakings Given in the Tripartite Agreements  \n The scope of each party’s undertakings should be clarified, by reference to \nthe terms of the agreements, before it is determined whether Quebec breach ed the \nrequirements of good faith and the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown \nin carrying out the agreements.  \n According to Quebec, the regime set forth in the Police Act  [TRANSLATION ] \n“is implemented through the agreements entered into” (A.F.,  at para.  54). These \nagreements show that Quebec [ TRANSLATION ] “promised to contribute financially to \nthe establishment and maintenance of a police force by [Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan], in the amounts specified in the agreements and in compliance with th e \nmandate conferred on other police forces by the [ Act]” (para.  58). However, it never \npromised to provide “100 percent” of the funding for the SPM (transcript, day 1, at \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n \n pp. 20, 23 and 38), and the federal Policy , which does not have the force of law, cre ates \nno obligations for Quebec.  \n As for the respondent, it argues that Quebec is giving a [ TRANSLATION ] \n“restrictive interpretation” to the promise it made (R.F., at para.  6). It anchors its own \nanalysis of Quebec’s promise in [ TRANSLATION ] “the State’s res ponsibility to ensure \nthe safety of its citizens” (para.  43) and in the legislative debates surrounding the \nenactment of the first version of what is now s.  90 of the Act (paras.  49 and 84). With \nregard to the federal Policy , the respondent explains that [ TRANSLATION ] “[Quebec’s] \nactions relating to the establishment of the SPM were taken in conjunction with the \nimplementation of the federal policy, such that [Quebec] implicitly adhered to the \nFNPP and its terms and conditions” (para.  78). For these reasons , it submits that \nQuebec’s undertaking [ TRANSLATION ] “is not confined to the terms of the tripartite \nagreements” (para.  86). \n What in fact was the undertaking that Quebec gave to Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan in entering into the tripartite agreements coverin g the period of 2013 to \n2017?  \n It should be noted at the outset that Quebec’s undertakings are contractual \nin nature. The tripartite agreements were entered into pursuant to the provisions of the \nAct that authorize the government — without making this a sta tutory obligation — to \n“enter into an agreement with one or more Native communities .  . . to establish or \nmaintain  a police force in a territory determined under the agreement” ( Act, s. 90).

Ménard)).  \n I turn now to the text of these agreements, which are all similar and based \non the same general framework. Like the parties and the Court of Appeal, I will refer \nto the 2015 -2016 agreement (reproduced in A.R., vol.  III, at p.  58) to illustrate my \ncomments, although there are minor variations from one agreement to another.  \n To begin with, I not e that there is an entire agreement clause. The \nagreement, including its preamble and certain schedules, [ TRANSLATION ] “constitutes \nthe entirety of the parties’ undertakings and responsibilities” (cl.  1.1). Unless the \ncontrary is indicated elsewhere in the  agreement, this clause prevents the federal Policy  \nand Terms and Conditions  from being considered part of the agreement and thus \nbinding on Quebec. The only contrary indication is in the third recital of the preamble, \nbut Quebec is not mentioned in that r ecital.  \n The purpose of the agreement is made apparent in the preamble and the \npurpose clause, which I reproduce below:  \n [TRANSLATION ] \n WHEREAS  the Parties agree on the importance for the Council of \nproviding the community of Mashteuiatsh (hereinafter referred to as \n“community”) with police services that are professional, dedicated and \nadapted to its needs and culture, in accordance with the appl icable statutes \nand regulations;  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n  WHEREAS  Canada and Quebec, in accordance with their respective \njurisdictions, wish to provide financial support for the expenses incurred \nby the Council to establish and maintain police services for the community;  \n AND WHE REAS  Canada will provide its share of the financial \ncontribution under this agreement in accordance with the First Nations \nPolicing Program  (FNPP) and in compliance with the policies and terms \nand conditions related thereto.  \n. . . \n 1.5 OBJECTIVES OF THE AGREEMENT  \n The objectives of this agreement are as follows:  \na) to establish and maintain the “Mashteuiatsh Police Force” (hereinafter \nreferred to as “police force”) that will be responsible for ensuring the \nprovision of police services in the community in acc ordance with the \nPolice Act  (CQLR, chapter P -13.1);  \nb) to establish a contribution from Canada and Quebec to the funding for \nthe provision of the police services covered by this agreement.  \n These excerpts show that one purpose of the agreement is “to establish  and \nmaintain the ‘Mashteuiatsh Police Force’” (cl.  1.5a)) so that it can provide the \ncommunity with “police services that are professional, dedicated and adapted to its \nneeds and culture, in accordance with the applicable statutes and regulations” \n(preamb le, first recital; see also cl.  2.9.2).  \n This purpose is achieved by attaining the goal set out in clause  1.5b), which \nis “to establish a contribution from Canada and Quebec to the funding for the provision \nof the police services covered by this agreement”.  This contribution represents \n“financial support for the expenses incurred by [Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan] to \nestablish and maintain police services for the community” (preamble, second recital). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n This purpose obviously depends on the first: in order for t here to be a police force to \nfund, a police force must, of course, be established or maintained.  \n The purpose of ensuring the maintenance of the SPM is also implemented \nthrough a series of obligations resting on Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan.

Under the \nagreem ent, it is [ TRANSLATION ] “responsible for the administrative management” of \nthe SPM and “shall see to its organization” (cl.  2.1.3). For example, it is the employer \nof the SPM’s members, its chief of police and its support staff (cls.  2.1.3 and 2.3). It \nmust prescribe the manner of dealing with criminal allegations made against them and \nmust adopt an internal discipline bylaw (cls.  2.7 and 2.8). It may also establish internal \npolicies and procedures for the administrative management of the SPM (cl.  2.1.4).  \n The SPM is a police force within the meaning of the Act (cl. 2.1.1). It must \ncarry out the mission assigned to Indigenous police forces by s.  93 of the Act in \ncompliance with its internal discipline bylaw, the Code of ethics of Québec police \nofficers , CQLR , c.

In particular, the \nSPM is r esponsible [ TRANSLATION ] “for ensuring a police presence that makes it \npossible to respond, within a reasonable time, to the requests for assistance made to it” \n(cl. 2.2.2a)). In addition, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan has obligations relating to \npolice faci lities and equipment; for example, it supplies the equipment needed to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n \n provide police services, paying the cost of its maintenance and arranging for its \nreplacement (cls.  3.2 and 3.3).  \n The agreement provides that Quebec and Canada must contribute to the \nSPM’s funding. It sets the “maximum amount” of the costs of the police services \nfunded by them:  \n [TRANSLATION ] \n4.2.1  The maximum amount of the costs associated with the police services \nfunded by Canada and Quebec is established:  \na) by fiscal year beginning on A pril 1 of a calendar year and ending \non March  31 of the subsequent calendar year; and  \nb) in accordance with the budget in Schedule A of this agreement, \nat $1,226,750 for fiscal year 2015 -2016.  \n This amount may vary from one agreement to another and may be reduced \nif other government funds are also used to achieve the purpose of the agreement \n(cl. 4.7.2). It is, however, a [ TRANSLATION ] “fixed contributio[n]”, to use \nBouchard  J.A.’s expression (C.A. reasons, at para.  21). The funds must be spent in \ncomplianc e with the allocation rules set out in the agreement (Sch. A; see also cls.  4.2.3 \nto 4.2.7 and 4.6). Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan is accountable for what has not been \nspent (cl.  4.3.5).  \n Canada and Quebec share responsibility for the government contribution \nin a ratio of 52 percent for Canada and 48  percent for Quebec (cl.  4.2.2).

If the funding is reduced, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan may \nitself terminate the agreement (cl.  4.4.3).  \n Clause 4.5.2 is a provision on which the parties di sagree. It provides that \nthe respondent [ TRANSLATION ] “shall be responsible for any budget deficits incurred \nduring a fiscal year”, and it specifies that a deficit “may not be carried forward to the \nnext fiscal year”. Therefore, according to the text of th e agreements, the contribution \nof the governments of Canada and Quebec is capped and, if the SPM’s costs are higher, \nit is the respondent that must pay the difference.  \n While the 2015 -2016 agreement is a one -year agreement, its content \nreveals that it conte mplates a long -term contractual relationship, which, as noted above, \nhas been in place since the initial 1996 agreement, as that agreement has been renewed \nthrough an uninterrupted series of agreements with varying terms. It goes without \nsaying that the ma intenance of a police force, with the associated staff, infrastructure \nand equipment, is by its very nature a long -term endeavour.  \n The agreement therefore expressly provides that [ TRANSLATION ] “[w]here \nfunds .  . . received by [Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan]  under a prior agreement .  . . \nhave not been spent”, Canada and Quebec may authorize it “to retain that amount as \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n \n partial payment of their respective obligations”, that is, as partial payment of a \ncontribution owed under a subsequent agreement (cls.  4.3.5 and 4.3.6).  \n Similarly, a number of clauses refer to the idea that the agreement, despite \nbeing annual, may extend over several fiscal periods of one year each. More \nspecifically, certain clauses use the phrases [ TRANSLATION ] “each fiscal year” \n(cls. 3.2.2,  4.2.2, 4.9.1, 4.9.2 and 4.13.2), “a fiscal year” (cls.  4.2.5 and 4.9.3), “that \nfiscal year” (cl.  4.2.5) and “last fiscal year covered” (cl.  4.10.1). As well, clause 4.3.1, \nwhich deals with cash flow statements, refers to [ TRANSLATION ] “each fiscal year”, the \n“only or the first fiscal year”, the “fiscal year in question” and a “subsequent fiscal \nyear”. Finally, clause 4.5.2 expressly provides that budget deficits incurred during “a \nfiscal year” may not be carried forward “to the next fiscal year”.  \n These var ious provisions imply that there may be several fiscal years and \ntherefore that the agreement may be renewable as long as no party chooses to avail \nitself of the termination clause. That clause gives the parties considerable latitude, \nincluding by stipulat ing that [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he agreement may be terminated in \nany of the following situations: .  . . d) at any time by any party, even if there is no \ndefault by another party” (cl.  6.6.1).  \n Clause 6.10.2 specifies how an agreement may be extended so that it can \nbe renewed by entering into a [ TRANSLATION ] “new agreement”:  \n [TRANSLATION ] \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n  6.10.2  However, if, before March  31, 2016, the parties expressly agree, \nby written notice sent to the other parties, to maintain the \nprovisions of this agreement, these provisions, except the sections \non funding in Part IV, shall remain in force until a new agreement \non the provision of police services is entered into.

Moreover, since a notice of extension does not \nhave the effect of extending the funding provisions, the decision to prolong an annual \nagreement implies that the parties must renegotiate the funding provisions when a “new \nagreement” is entered into. Clause 6.10.2 therefore creates an obligation to negotiate \nthe funding terms, but only if the parties decide to continue their contractual \nrelationship, since they are free to end it at any time.  \n I note that the agre ement’s interpretive provisions also include a clause \nstating that the agreement is governed by Quebec law, a severability clause and a clause \nsetting out the legal scope of the agreement. Under the last of these clauses, the \nagreement does not affect Abor iginal or treaty rights and must not be interpreted to be \nan agreement or treaty within the meaning of s.  35 of the Constitution Act, 1982  \n(cls. 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4).  \n In conclusion, Quebec undertook to Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan by \ncontract to help it establ ish and then maintain, particularly by means of limited financial \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n contributions, a police force serving the community of Mashteuiatsh. The terms of the \nagreements reveal that this undertaking contemplates a long -term relationship during \nwhich the funding f or the police force will be reassessed and renegotiated before \nentering into each new agreement.  \n Following this overview of the contractual undertakings, it must be \ndetermined whether Quebec performed them in compliance with the requirements of \ngood faith and with the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown, if this \nprinciple was in fact engaged.  \nA. Bases for Quebec’s Liability  \n(1) Good Faith, a Source of Private Law Obligations  \n Quebec invites the Court to decide the appeal on the basis of the contractual  \nliability regime, as the Superior Court did. It relies first and foremost on the principle \nof the binding force of contracts and submits that the funding provisions of the tripartite \nagreements are clear: under clauses 4.2.1 and 4.5.2, the governments of Canada and \nQuebec undertook to fund the costs of the Indigenous police force up to a “maximum \namount”, and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan accepted responsibility for any deficit \nincurred during each fiscal year. According to Quebec, the judge was correct in f inding \nthat [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he contract is the law of the parties” and, given that there was \nno ambiguity making it necessary to interpret the freely chosen terms, he was right to \n“give full effect to the tripartite agreements” in order to dismiss the ac tion (Sup. Ct. \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n reasons, at paras.  56 and 88). Citing, among other authorities, Uniprix inc. v. Gestion \nGosselin et Bérubé inc. , 2017 SCC 43, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 59, Quebec argues that the \nCourt of Appeal should not have intervened, since the trial judge’s conc lusions were \nentitled to deference on appeal.  \n Furthermore, Quebec acknowledges that, like any other party to a contract, \nit was required to perform its contractual obligations [ TRANSLATION ] “in good faith” \n(A.F., at para.  37). However, the trial judge foun d that the evidence [ TRANSLATION ] \n“does not support the allegations of bad faith” made against the governments of Canada \nand Quebec, and wrote that their communications with Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \nwere characterized by “transparency”, “respect” and “a ppreciation” (Sup. Ct. reasons, \nat para.  72). This highly factual determination was also entitled to deference on appeal. \nOn the whole, Quebec takes the view that no fault engaging its liability could be \nattributed to it.  \n As for Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan , it criticizes Quebec for \n[TRANSLATION ]",

This highly factual determination was also entitled to deference on appeal. \nOn the whole, Quebec takes the view that no fault engaging its liability could be \nattributed to it.  \n As for Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan , it criticizes Quebec for \n[TRANSLATION ] “[t]he absence of true negotiation, the sharp dealing, the imposition of \nan inadequate budget [and] the arbitrary and unilateral establishment of the terms of \nthe tripartite agreements, without any real analysis of the needs in question” (R.F., at \npara.  140; see also paras.  5, 30, 105 and 128). This presented the respondent \n[TRANSLATION ] “with a false choice ”: either it agreed to renew the agreements without \nnegotiating their funding terms, thereby sinking further in to deficit, or it relied on the \nSQ (para.  99 (emphasis in original)).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n \n While the respondent urges this Court to consider the agreements \n[TRANSLATION ] “from the standpoint of public law” (R.F., at para.  144), it relies in the \nalternative on private law groun ds, as it believes that the two regimes “are compatible” \n(para.  145). In this regard, it adopts (at para.  146) the analysis of Bich  J.A., who found \nthat the conduct of Canada and Quebec constituted an abuse of right under the civil \nlaw. According to the re spondent, the federal and provincial governments thus engaged \nin contractual conduct that was unreasonable in the circumstances.  \n Contrary to what Quebec contends, and with all due respect for the trial \njudge, I am of the view that his conclusions regarding  the meaning to be given to the \nterms of the agreements and to contractual good faith were tainted by reviewable errors \nand, as a result, are not entitled to deference on appeal.  \n First, the judge applied the wrong test in rejecting the argument that the \ngovernments of Canada and Quebec had breached the requirements of good faith. The \njudge’s conclusion that the governments did not evince bad faith does not necessarily \nmean that they complied with the requirements of good faith, as a breach of these \nrequirem ents can occur regardless of a party’s intention or state of mind. It is true that \nacting dishonestly in the performance of a contract and knowingly engaging in \nunlawful acts are examples of conduct that is lacking in good faith (see, e.g., \nHydro -Québec v.  Construction Kiewit cie , 2014 QCCA 947, at para.  54; see also \nPonce , at para.  79, citing C.M. Callow Inc. v. Zollinger , 2020 SCC 45, [2020] 3 S.C.R. \n908, at para.  89). That being said, good faith also entails prohibitions that can be \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n analyzed objectively,  such as those against unduly increasing the burden on the other \ncontracting party, behaving in an excessive or unreasonable manner or jeopardizing the \nexistence or equilibrium of the contractual relationship (see arts.  6, 7 and 1375 C.C.Q. ; \nPonce , at para . 76; Construction Kiewit , at paras.  55-56). The trial judge considered \ngood faith only in the subjective sense of the term, and, with respect, this error of law \nled him to entirely overlook the objective aspect of good faith, thereby stripping the \nprincip le of much of its meaning.  \n As for the trial judge’s reading of the tripartite agreements, he was certainly \ncorrect in noting that Quebec had committed itself to pay maximum amounts and that \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan had agreed to assume the deficits incu rred. However, \nthese observations were not sufficient to address the argument that Quebec had \nbreached its duties under arts.  6, 7 and 1375 C.C.Q.  by failing to negotiate the renewal \nof the agreements in good faith. With respect, the trial judge ignored th e fact that the \nscheme of the agreements reflects, in particular through the mechanism set out in clause \n6.10.2, the idea that they must be renewed in order for the police force to be maintained. \nThis clause is essential to understanding the allegation tha t the",

It is in fact the making of \nnew agreements, which clause 6.10.2 authorizes, that allows the contracting parties to \nachieve the objective of maintaining the police force  over time. The failure to consider \nthis aspect of the agreements is therefore a palpable error with an overriding effect, \nbecause the judge could not correctly assess whether Quebec had performed its \nobligations in accordance with the requirements of good  faith without taking account \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n \n of the fact that, with each renewal, Quebec had an obligation to negotiate the funding \nclauses in good faith.  \n These errors justify undertaking a fresh analysis, starting with the \nframework imposed by art.  1376 C.C.Q. , which applies  to an action concerning the \ncivil liability of the State.  \n The tripartite agreements are contracts entered into by the governments of \nCanada and Quebec and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. Under art.  1376 C.C.Q. , the \ngeneral rules in Book Five of the Civil Code  — “Obligations” — apply to the State, to \nthe extent that they are not excluded or altered by other rules of law. The tripartite \nagreements are therefore governed by the general law of obligations, including \nart. 1375 C.C.Q.  on good faith. This Cou rt recently noted that good faith is an enacted \nstandard of public order that applies at every stage of the contractual relationship \n(Ponce , at para.  70, relying on arts.  1375 and 1434 C.C.Q. ). This point is not in dispute \nhere.  \n No party argues that the pu blic order rule of good faith is excluded by an \nincompatible rule of public law. In this regard, it should also be noted that the “entirety \nof the parties’ undertakings and responsibilities” clause (cl.  1.1) does not exclude the \npublic order standard of go od faith (see Développement Olymbec inc. v. Avanti Spa de \nJour inc. , 2019 QCCS 1198; C. Lebrun, “La clause d’intégralité au Québec” (2008), \n67 R. du B.  39, at pp.  47 and 56). Commenting on Quebec jurisprudence, author \nCatherine Valcke writes that [ TRANSLATION ] “[s]uch a clause cannot .  . . exclude the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n \n obligation of good faith provided for in article 1375 C.C.Q.” (J.  Pineau et al. , Théorie \ndes obligations  (5th ed. 2023), by C.  Valcke, at No.  859, fn.  971).  \n The parties are therefore correct in recogni zing, as the trial judge did (at \npara.  55), that Quebec was required to perform its contractual undertakings in good \nfaith.  \n(a) Duties Flowing From the Obligation To Act in Good Faith  \n Although the obligation to act in good faith applies to every contract, “its  \nimplementation varies with the circumstances” ( Ponce , at para.  71; see also Churchill \nFalls , at para.  104). The respondent’s arguments in this regard are focused on the need \nto perform contractual obligations in accordance with the requirements of good fa ith \npursuant to art.  1375 C.C.Q.  In alleging that the governments of Canada and Quebec \nbreached their obligation to “negotiate” in good faith, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \nis clearly not referring to the initial negotiation of their relationship during a \npre-contractual phase going back to 1996 — in theory, a source of extracontractual \nliability and, in any event, far removed from the period at issue.

The respondent is not \nfocusing on a possible obligation to renegotiate a contract in good faith in the absen ce \nof any renewal mechanism set out in the contract. Nor is it relying on the unforeseeable \noccurrence of deficits to justify the need for good faith negotiation. Renewal was \ncontemplated by the parties, who viewed it, in the very text of the tripartite ag reements, \nas a means of ensuring the maintenance of the police force.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n \n \n Given that the maintenance of the SPM is a purpose of the agreements and \nthat, for most of the period at issue, the agreements were annual, the parties specifically \nprovided for an exten sion mechanism in clause 6.10.2 to facilitate renewal in the event \nthat the negotiations were not completed before the agreements expired. \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan raises the renewal negotiations contemplated notably \nby clause 6.10.2, which were, howeve r, not always conducted through that clause, in \narguing that Quebec’s refusal to discuss an increase in funding constitutes unreasonable \nconduct contrary to the requirements of good faith.  \n After a contract is entered into, [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he obligation t o \nnegotiate in good faith may .  . . have a contractual basis and flow from the terms of the \ncontract” (B.  Lefebvre, La bonne foi dans la formation du contrat  (1998), at p.  122), \nespecially where the parties intend to renew the contract in a manner contempl ated by \nit. In Trizec Equities Ltd. v. Hassine  (1988), 27 Q.A.C. 167, which was decided under \nthe Civil Code of Lower Canada , Monet  J.A. explained that good faith must \n[TRANSLATION ] “preside over the entire contractual realm .  . . over both the \nperformance  and the formation of the contract” (para.  9). He held that the imposition \nof such an obligation was justified in the circumstances given the presence of a renewal \nclause in a commercial lease. Thus, where parties have provided through a clause that \nthey w ill have to enter into negotiations, the obligation to conduct the negotiations in \ngood faith flows directly from the contract. Pursuant to art.  1375 C.C.Q. , therefore, the \nperformance of contractual provisions that contemplate negotiation must, as with an y \nother contractual obligation, be in compliance with the standards of good faith. A \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n \n breach of good faith in negotiating a renewal contemplated by a contract may thus be \na source of contractual liability ( Singh v. Kohli , 2015 QCCA 1135, at para.  67; see al so \nBillards Dooly’s inc. v. Entreprises Prébour ltée , 2014 QCCA 842, at para.  98, and \nCentre de santé et de services sociaux de l’Énergie v. Maison Claire Daniel inc. , 2012 \nQCCA 1975, at para.  80). \n Although good faith requires more than the absence of bad faith, it does \nnot require parties to subordinate their interests to those of the other parties ( Ponce , at \npara.  77). It is well established that good faith does not serve to “transform the \nobjectives of corrective justice [it is] intended to protect into a mechanism of \ndistributive justice that would be unpredictable and contrary to contractual stability” \n(Churchill Falls , at para.  125). In the case at bar, good faith does not require the parties \nto forsake their own interests to benefit their counterparti es in the performance of the \nagreement. But as the Court noted in Ponce , “in the pursuit of their interests and the \nexercise of their rights, parties to a contract must conduct themselves loyally by not \nunduly increasing the burden on the other party or be having in an excessive or \nunreasonable manner” (para.  76). \n It is true that no effect can be given to a contractual clause that is contrary \nto public order, a concept that includes the implied obligation to act in good faith that \napplies to every contract t hrough",

Baudouin and P. -G. Jobin, Les obligations (7th ed. 2013), by P. -G. Jobin and \nN. Vézina, at No.  415). In this sense, good faith in the performance of a contract must \nbe seen as a standard that does not conflict with the binding force of contracts, but is \nits ally. Performing  a contract in good faith does not require the debtor to renounce its \nrights.  \n Similarly, good faith does not permit the creditor to go back on its word. \nAs author Laurent Aynès writes about French law, good faith is [ TRANSLATION ] “a duty \nof conduct that in volves making the performance of the contract consistent with what \nwas undertaken” (preface by L.  Aynès in R.  Jabbour, La bonne foi dans l’exécution du \ncontrat  (2016), at p.  VII). In the instant case, good faith performance of the clauses \ncontemplating the  renewal of the contract cannot serve, for example, to require or \nimpose specific outcomes from the negotiations. That being said, a party that enters \ninto negotiations in good faith must consider the interests of any other party to the \nnegotiations and av oid behaving unreasonably (see Singh , at paras.  67 and 74; \nJolicoeur v. Rainville , 2000 CanLII 30012 (Que. C.A.), at para.  51). Negotiating \ntenaciously in one’s self -interest — an approach that can be entirely compatible with \ngood faith — does not mean neg otiating in an obstinate or intransigent manner that \nwould undermine the counterparty’s legitimate expectations. Good faith requires \nparties who discuss a renewal clause to negotiate faithfully. Parties are of course free \n— again, subject to the requiremen ts of good faith — to end their existing contractual \nrelationship. But when they begin renewal negotiations as permitted by the very terms \nof the contract, they are obliged to behave a manner that is neither excessive nor \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n \n unreasonable in this final stage o f carrying out their agreement (see, e.g., Société \nsylvicole de l’Outaouais v. Rasmussen , 2005 QCCA 729, at paras.  27-28). Refusal to \nact in good faith in the negotiation of a renewal contemplated by the parties may \njeopardize the very purpose of the contr act where, as here, the achievement of that \npurpose depends on the existence of a relationship over time (see D.  Lluelles and \nB. Moore, Droit des obligations  (3rd ed. 2018), at Nos.  1979 -80 and 1987).  \n(b) Quebec’s Breach of the Requirements of Good Faith in Ne gotiations  \n Did Quebec breach its duty to perform the tripartite agreements in good \nfaith during the renegotiations contemplated by these agreements?  \n Quebec argues that the Court of Appeal made several errors in arriving at \nthe conclusion that it committed an abuse of right in performing its contractual \nobligations. First of all, the Court of Appeal could not find a breach on the basis of \nnon-compliance with commitments set out in the federal Policy , as the Policy  does not \ngive rise to obligations and is not  binding on Quebec. In addition, it could not find an \nabuse of right because it did not identify any right set out in the contract that Quebec \nhad supposedly abused. Quebec submits that the Court of Appeal failed to show \ndeference to the trial judge’s conc lusion that the evidence supported neither a finding \nthat the governments of Canada and Quebec had acted in bad faith nor a finding that \nthe community of Mashteuiatsh was receiving",

First, Quebec is correct to \nsay that the federal Policy  does not give rise to obligations and does not bind it directly. \nIt is true that, by entering into the tripartite agreements, Quebec vol untarily agreed to \ntake part in the collaborative exercise contemplated by the Policy governing the FNPP. \nBut that “adherence” to the model proposed by the federal government does not, legally \nspeaking, entail acceptance of the actual terms of the Policy  as a contractual obligation. \nQuebec’s undertakings toward Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan find their source in the \nseries of tripartite agreements, which are themselves governed by the Act, and not in \nfederal documents or policies. Second, Quebec is also correc t to say that the very text \nof the agreements stipulates that the federal and provincial governments were not \ncommitting themselves to fully fund the SPM. Rather, Quebec gave an undertaking to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan to help it establish and then maint ain the SPM through \nlimited financial contributions. Consequently, the mere fact that Quebec made funding \noffers that were insufficient to cover the SPM’s costs does not amount to a breach of \ncontract.  \n However, this does not dispose of the question. Like a ny other contracting \nparty, Quebec had an obligation to act in good faith, including when conducting the \nnegotiations contemplated by the agreements.  \n The circumstances invite four comments.  \n First, I disagree with Quebec that [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he Superior C ourt’s \ndecision to allow the governments’ objection to the filing in evidence of the ‘Viens \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n \n report’, released well after the agreements in question were entered into, should have \nbeen upheld on appeal” (A.F., at para.  103). Quebec has not indicated how \nBouchard  J.A. erred in finding that [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he purpose of the exhibits \ncontemplated in the .  . . objection to the evidence [of Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan] \nwas .  . . to provide context for” the issues (C.A. reasons, at para.  64). There is therefore \nno basis for disturbing that finding by the Court of Appeal. Quebec’s renewed objection \nseeking the exclusion of exhibits should be dismissed for the same reasons given by \nBouchard  J.A. These exhibits are relevant, and considering them would have enabled \nthe trial judge to better understand the meaning to be given to the respondent’s \narguments on both good faith and the honour of the Crown.  \n With regard to the decision itself, I begin by reiterating that the \ngovernments of Canada and Quebec knew, from year t o year, that the Indigenous police \nforce was underfunded. As will be seen below, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan clearly \ncommunicated its funding needs to both governments at the time of each renewal. The \ngovernments also knew that the funding problems did not  result from its \nmismanagement of police services. Moreover, they knew, at least through the inquiry \nreports, that the maintenance of the police force, one of the purposes of the agreements \nset out in clause 1.5a), had the great advantage of providing the community of \nMashteuiatsh with policing that was both culturally appropriate and not tied to the SQ’s \ntroubled past. However, Quebec chose not to terminate the agreements but to continue \nthe contractual relationship in order to maintain the SPM, while at t he same time \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n \n refusing to revisit its financial contribution.

This is apparent from the very purpose of the agreements, which includes \nestablishing and maintaining a police station in Mashteuiatsh (preamble and cl.  1.5), \nbut also from the clauses that indicate, throug h the concept of fiscal year, that the \nframework of the agreements can be extended to cover multiple years (see cls.  3.2.2, \n4.2.2, 4.2.5, 4.3.1, 4.5.2, 4.9.1 to 4.9.3, 4.10.1 and 4.13), from the clauses referring to \nthe existence or making of subsequent ag reements (cls.  4.3.5, 4.3.6 and 6.10.2) and \nfrom the clause governing the renewal of the agreement (cl.  6.10.2).  \n Third, the scheme of the agreements shows that the parties agreed to \nrenegotiate the funding provisions if they chose to renew the agreements. In this regard, \nclause 6.10.2 states that if, before the expiry of an agreement, “the parties expressly \nagree, by written notice sent to the other parties, to maintain the provisions of th[e] \nagreement, these provisions, except the sections on funding in P art IV, shall remain in \nforce until a new agreement on the provision of police services is entered into”. Clause \n6.10.2 thus lays down the rule that where written notice is given to the other parties, \nthe provisions of an agreement will remain in force unt il a new agreement is entered \ninto, apart from the funding clauses, which the parties will have to negotiate. Given the \npurpose of the contract, which aims to maintain the police force indefinitely, and the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n \n presence of clause 6.10.2, which shows that the a greements contemplate renewal \nnegotiations for the funding clauses, I am of the view that the parties had an obligation \nto carry out any renewal negotiations in good faith, whether they availed themselves of \nextension clause 6.10.2 or proceeded in some oth er manner.  \n Fourth, a number of factors contributed to creating an atmosphere of trust \nbetween the parties. In this regard, I note in particular that the tripartite agreements are \nbetween the State and a band council representing a First Nation in pursuit o f \nself-government and that the parties have maintained a contractual relationship \ncontinuously since 1996. There is also, of course, the extension clause referred to \nabove. In addition, I am of the view that the federal documents are relevant at this stage  \nof the analysis, not as a source of Quebec’s undertakings but rather as part of the \nbackdrop to the negotiations.  \n Under the agreements, the parties were not required to continue their \ncontractual relationship beyond the stipulated expiry date; they could even terminate \nthe agreements at any time (cls.  6.6.1 and 6.6.2). That being said, any party choosing \nto continue the contractual relationship by entering into a new agreement with the other \nparties, through the renewal mechanism, was required to negotiate  the funding terms \nof the new agreement in good faith and thus to consider the interests of the other parties.  \n It is important to note that, in the case of the agreements, the parties \nthemselves provided for the possibility of renewal to ensure the mainte nance of police \nservices over the long term. Quebec certainly had no obligation to renew the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n \n arrangement for another fiscal year — the agreements included a generous option to \nterminate — but if it sought to do so, the agreements show that renewal would be  \nachieved through negotiation. In such a case, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan was not \nentitled to a specific level of funding, but, by the terms of the contracts themselves, it \ndid have a legitimate expectation that Quebec would consider its perspective in \nnegotiating the extent of its contribution.

In such a case, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan was not \nentitled to a specific level of funding, but, by the terms of the contracts themselves, it \ndid have a legitimate expectation that Quebec would consider its perspective in \nnegotiating the extent of its contribution. However, by adopting an intransigent position \nthrough its refusal to negotiate, Quebec acted contrary to what the agreements \nstipulated and to the binding force of contracts as enshrined in art.  1434 C.C.Q.  In so \ndoing, it failed to carry out the agreements in good faith.  \n Indeed, through its obstinate refusal to negotiate, Quebec caused injury to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan by acting in conflict with the expectations raised by the \ncontractual mechanism put in place by the parties for the renewal of the agreements. \nRecognized in court decisions and legal scholarship under the umbrella of good faith, \na duty to act in keeping with such expectations must, in principle, be fulfilled in the \nperformance of a contract (see, e.g., Construction Kiewit , at para.  92; Baudouin, Jobin \nand Vézina, at No.  126). Quebec’s conduct was therefore unreasonable because it \nundermined the respondent’s legitimate expectations and disrupted the parties’ shared \ncontractual objective of maintaini ng the SPM. As one author has noted in an article \ndiscussing, among other things, the renegotiation of construction contracts, \n[TRANSLATION ] “an inflexible or rigid stance could compromise the contractual \nrelationship ‘without regard for the contracting pa rtner’s legitimate expectations’” and \nwould thus amount to a breach of good faith (M. -H. Dufour, “L’impact de la bonne foi \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n \n en droit de la construction” (2023), 57 R.J.T.U.M.  229, at p.  262, quoting Churchill \nFalls , at para.  118).  \n Here, good faith works han d in hand with the binding force of contracts to \nsanction Quebec’s obstinate refusal to negotiate the renewal of the agreements. In my \nview, by refusing to enter into genuine negotiations regarding the funding clauses \ndespite knowing that its inadequate fu nding offers were causing difficulties for \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan and even jeopardizing the maintenance of the SPM, \nQuebec breached its contractual obligation of good faith in the renewal of the \nagreements. In short, the evidence in the record shows t hat the financial contribution \nof the federal and provincial governments was inadequate in light of the SPM’s actual \ncosts, that substantial deficits were incurred over the years and that Quebec refused to \nnegotiate the funding level, thereby breaching its  duty to consider the respondent’s \ninterests during the renewal negotiations. Through that conduct, Quebec endangered \nthe very purpose of the agreements, which aim above all to ensure the maintenance of \nan Indigenous police force in Mashteuiatsh. It is tru e, as the respondent argues, that the \nabsence of genuine negotiations left it in a no -win situation: renewing the agreement \nwould add to the deficit, and failing to renew it would mean the end of the SPM and a \nreturn to the SQ’s services, with the difficul ties this would entail.  \n Until 2009, the government contribution to the SPM’s funding was \nsufficient to cover most of its costs without Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan having to \nassume very substantial deficits. For 2009 -2010, it informed the governments of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n \n Canada and Quebec that it needed additional funds. They replied that, because of the \nsignificant budgetary constraints faced by the FNPP, they were prepared to renew the \n2008 -2009 agreement on the same funding terms, and thus without increasing their \ncontribu tion. In 2012, following other such refusals over the years, the respondent \ndenounced the fact that the renewal of the agreement had, once again, [ TRANSLATION ] \n“taken place without due regard for the real needs of the community”, noting that “for \na third y ear in a row, [it] is forced to accept the proposed agreement” and that its \nacceptance of the offer “is not an acknowledgement that the funding meets [its] needs” \n(resolution of the Conseil des Montagnais du Lac -Saint -",

I, at p. 172, \npara.  37). Furthermore, the federal and provincial governments were informed of the \nSPM’s actual costs through Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s yearly financial \nstatements (Sup.  Ct. reasons, at para.  34). At trial, a Quebec representative thus \nacknowledged that the government was [ TRANSLATION ] “very, very aware of the \nsituation in Mashteuiatsh” with respect to the SPM’s funding (A.R., vol.  XVII, at \np. 65). \n The quality of the SPM’s services suffered as a result of that underfunding, \nwhich forced the  SPM to operate [ TRANSLATION ] “at the very lowest of the lowest” \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n \n (C.A. reasons, at para.  99, quoting witness V.  Tremblay). To make up for the \ninadequacy of the funding, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan reduced the minimum \nnumber of police officers specified in the agreements, which thus fell from 11 to 10 \nofficers for 2015 -2016 (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para.  26). Despite that reduction, the \ninadequacy of the funding led it to announce that the SPM would be abolished as of \nApril  1, 2016, a decision it communicated t o Canada and Quebec in November 2015. \nIt later reversed that decision after Quebec agreed to provide it with supplemental \nassistance.  \n The governments of Canada and Quebec explained that the underfunding \nof the FNPP prevented them from significantly increas ing their financial contribution. \nThe budget allocated to that program grew by only 1.5 percent during the period of \n2014 to 2017, whereas the RCMP’s expenditures rose by 27 percent from 2008 -2009 \nto 2016 -2017 and those of the SQ by 15 percent from 2011 to  2017. Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan’s requests were therefore flatly rejected, as the governments of Canada and \nQuebec turned [ TRANSLATION ] “a deaf ear to its requests and complaints” (C.A. \nreasons, at para.  136).  \n In these circumstances, as Bouchard J.A. po inted out, Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan felt like there was a [ TRANSLATION ] “knife to the throat” (C.A. reasons, at \npara.  101 (emphasis deleted), quoting witness V.  Tremblay): either it continued to \nimpoverish itself to maintain the SPM and preserve the pro gress that the SPM \nrepresented in terms of self -government, or it abolished the SPM, which meant both \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n \n returning to the SQ’s services and suffering a setback with respect to self -government \n(paras.  136-37, per Bich  J.A.). That situation was particularly ser ious given the \ndifficulties associated with the SQ’s presence in Indigenous communities. The \nrespondent was effectively presented “with a false choice ”, and the maintenance of the \nSPM depended on its acceptance of Quebec’s proposals [ TRANSLATION ] “without any \npossibility of negotiating”, which would “further exacerbat[e] its shortfall in funding” \n(R.F., at para.  99). \n Despite the difficulties this caused it, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan made \nthe choice, year after year, to preserve the SPM, which required it to use its own funds \nto absorb the SPM’s annual deficits",

It was known to the governments of Canada and \nQuebec that an arbitration award was issued against Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan on \nJuly 17, 2014. That award, which granted the SPM’s police officers a retroactive pay \nincrease of $853,000, is directly related to the program’s underfunding and explains \nthe especially large deficit incurred in 2014 -2015. According to the SPM’s chief of \npolice, the representatives of the governments of Canada and Quebec ack nowledged, \nat a meeting in November 2015, the financial hardship that had been caused by the \narbitration award but stated that additional funding could not be offered for the coming \nyears given the post -election context at the federal level (testimony of S . Vanier, \nreproduced in A.R., vol.  XVI, at p.  169).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n \n \n No mismanagement by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan has been alleged as \nan explanation for these deficits. Indeed, the respondent is recognized to be a model \nbeneficiary under the FNPP, one that manages its f inances well.  \n In my view, Quebec’s intransigence reflects indifference to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s interests and constitutes a breach of the obligation to \nnegotiate the clauses relating to its financial contribution in good faith at the time of \nthe re newal contemplated by the agreements. Quebec should have entered into genuine \nnegotiations with its counterparty and should have listened and shown openness, which \nwas not the case. Moreover, if Quebec was unable to proceed in this manner, it could \nhave ex ercised its right of termination pursuant to clauses 6.6 and 6.7. In light of the \ncircumstances, including the presence of an extension clause providing for the \nnegotiation of the funding clauses and the existence of a long -term contractual \nrelationship, Q uebec could not simply make non -negotiable funding offers that took no \naccount of Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s interests.  \n Such conduct constitutes an abuse of right within the meaning of Houle  \nand art.  7 C.C.Q.  I cannot accept Quebec’s argument that it di d not abuse any of its \ncontractual rights. Both parties had the right to request the renewal of the annual \nagreements in order to ensure the maintenance of the police force. Quebec exercised \nthat right in an unreasonable manner and, in so doing, abused the  right to renew and \nextend the agreement in accordance with the terms of clause 6.10.2 or by any other \nmeans in the contract agreed on by the parties. The description of abuse of right given \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n \n by Forget  J.A. in a leading Court of Appeal decision can, in my v iew, be transposed to \nthis case: [ TRANSLATION ] “. . . the [respondent] exercised its rights in a manner that \nwas blameworthy and contrary to the requirements of good faith. It acted unreasonably \n— even intransigently and obstinately — toward [the appellant ], clearly departing from \nthe standard of conduct of a prudent and diligent person” ( Développement Tanaka inc. \nv. Montréal (Commission scolaire) , 2007 QCCA 1122, 65 C.L.R. (3d) 175, at \npara.  128).  \n I am therefore of the opinion that the Court of Appeal made  no reviewable \nerror in finding an abuse of right, even if it did not specifically identify the right that \nQuebec abused, as the appellant points out.  \n Though this is not strictly necessary, I would go further. In the \ncircumstances, it was, in my view, also  unreasonable for Quebec to insist on the terms \nof clauses 4.2.1 and 4.5.2, which, respectively, set out its right to limit its financial \ncontribution and assign responsibility for deficits to Pekuakamiulnu",

In \nthe circumstances, insisting on strict adherence to the terms of those clauses was also \nan abuse of contractual rights.  As in Houle , where the bank’s conduct prevented it from \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n \n strictly relying on its r ight to demand payment without notice, Quebec could not, in \nthis case, insist on strict adherence to clauses 4.2.1 and 4.5.2.  \n I would add that the fact that Quebec adopted a better attitude during the \nlater renewal negotiations has no bearing on its liabil ity for the manner in which it \nconducted these negotiations during the period in issue.  \n As we will see below, the fact that Quebec allocated additional amounts to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan from time to time through various contract addenda and \nagreements  also does not alter the conclusion that it committed an abuse of right. For \none thing, that additional funding, which a representative of Canada described as \nsimply a “Band -Aid” (A.R., vol.  XVII, at p.  9), was not related in its entirety to the \ntripartite  agreements’ purpose of “establish[ing] and maintain[ing]” an Indigenous \npolice force. Moreover, that funding was not granted during the process of renewing \nthe agreements but rather outside that process, in an irregular and unpredictable \nmanner. In short,  Quebec’s subsequent contribution of additional financial support — \nwith strict conditions that did not allow for any good faith negotiation concerning the \nrecurring funding — does not change the fact that its refusal to abide by the contractual \nrenewal me chanism was a breach of the requirements of good faith. If the addenda have \nany importance, it is in relation to the assessment of injury, not to the violation of \narts. 6, 7 and 1375 C.C.Q.  \n(2) The Honour of the Crown, a Source of Public Law Obligations  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n \n \n Pekuak amiulnuatsh Takuhikan submits that the tripartite agreements must \nbe [ TRANSLATION ] “implemented” in a manner consistent with the honour of the \nCrown, which gives rise to obligations for Quebec (outline of argument, at p.  1, in \nrespondent’s condensed book, Tab 1), including the duty to negotiate the renewal of \nthe tripartite agreements with honour and integrity (R.F., at para.  99). According to it, \nQuebec did not comply with this duty.  \n Quebec, on the other hand, argues that the honour of the Crown does not \napply to its undertakings under the tripartite agreements, because the agreements fall \nwithin a [ TRANSLATION ] “category of agreements relating to public administration \n[that] is not subject to the same constitutional requirements as the negotiation of treat ies \nwith Indigenous peoples or the implementation of explicit obligations set out in the \nConstitution” (A.F., at para.  24). According to Quebec, the provision of police services \n[TRANSLATION ] “is a matter relevant to all Canadians and is not part of the di stinctive \nway of life of the members of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation” (para.  36, quoting \nSup. Ct. reasons, at para.  85). It is therefore not, Quebec says, a matter related to the \nreconciliation of Indigenous rights and interests, whether Aboriginal o r treaty, and the \nCrown’s assertion of sovereignty.  \n In the alternative, Quebec submits that, in any event, it fulfilled the \nobligations flowing from the honour of the Crown because it acted honourably in the \nnegot",

It is therefore not, Quebec says, a matter related to the \nreconciliation of Indigenous rights and interests, whether Aboriginal o r treaty, and the \nCrown’s assertion of sovereignty.  \n In the alternative, Quebec submits that, in any event, it fulfilled the \nobligations flowing from the honour of the Crown because it acted honourably in the \nnegotiation, interpretation and implementation o f the agreements entered into with \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan counters that, rather \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n \n than engaging in real negotiations to renew the agreements, Quebec imposed arbitrary \nfunding terms on it without considering the real costs of  providing culturally \nappropriate police services of an acceptable quality. Not only does that conduct \nconstitute a breach of the obligation to carry out the agreements in good faith, but, \naccording to the respondent, it is also a violation of the principl e of the honour of the \nCrown, which engages a higher standard of conduct.  \n This fundamental disagreement raises, for the first time in this Court, the \nquestion of whether the principle of the honour of the Crown applies to a contractual \nundertaking given by  the Crown to an Indigenous group.  \n Although this question was not raised by the parties, I will note for the sake \nof clarity that the “Government of Quebec”, as this term is used in the agreements, \nrefers in this context to both the “State” within the mean ing of art.  1376 C.C.Q.  and the \n“Crown” in right of the province with respect to the honour of the Crown. There is no \nneed to say any more about this here (see M. -F. Fortin, “L’État québécois et la \nCouronne canadienne: conception de la puissance publique à  la lumière du droit de la \nresponsabilité de la Couronne” (2022), 56 R.J.T.U.M.  379, at pp.  413-15). \n In what follows, we will see that, unlike good faith, the honour of the \nCrown does not apply to every contractual undertaking given by the Crown to an \nIndigenous entity. We must begin by identifying the test that can be used in this case \nto determine whether a contract is subject to the honour of the Crown. Once this test \nhas been established, we will look at the tripartite agreements to ascertain whether th ey \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n \n satisfy it. For this purpose, the Court will have to determine the [ TRANSLATION ] \n“characterization” of the agreements, that is, it will have to carry out the legal exercise \nthat leads to “the linking of the contract at issue to a normative category that  can serve \nto determine the applicable legal regime” (Lluelles and Moore, at No.  1729). If the \nagreements satisfy this test, we must then conclude that Quebec was required to \nperform the tripartite agreements in an honourable manner, and the question will be \nwhether Quebec complied with this obligation.  \n(a) Application of the Honour of the Crown to Contractual Undertakings  \n Our task at this first stage of the analysis is to identify the relevant test in \nthis case for determining whether the honour of the Crown a pplies to an agreement that \nis not constitutional in nature. As I noted above, not all contracts between the State and \nIndigenous peoples engage this principle. Since the Court has never addressed this \nquestion, I propose to proceed by analogy with the jur isprudence recognizing situations \nin which the honour of the Crown is engaged in order to draw therefrom the principles \nunderlying its application.  \n The honour of the Crown requires the Crown to act honourably in its \ndealings with Indigenous peoples. This principle arises from “the Crown’s assertion of \nsovereignty over an Aboriginal people and de facto  control of land and resources that \nwere formerly in the control of that people” ( Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada \n(Governor General in Council) , 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, at para.  21, per \nKarakatsanis  J., quoting Haida Nation , at para.  32, and citing MMF , at para.  66; see \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n \n also Hogg and Dougan).

That practice gave rise to a “special relationship” between the \nCrown and Indigenous peoples ( MMF , at para . 67, quoting Beckman , at para.  62). \n The underlying purpose of the principle of the honour of the Crown is to \nfacilitate the reconciliation of the Crown’s interests and those of Indigenous peoples, \nincluding by promoting negotiation and the just settlement  of Indigenous claims \n(Mikisew Cree , at para.  22; see also MMF , at para.  66; Taku River Tlingit First Nation  \nv. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director) , 2004 SCC 74, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 550, \nat para.  24; Desautel , at para.  22). This purpose transcends t he corrective justice at the \nheart of private law to make room for repairing and maintaining the special relationship \nwith the Indigenous peoples on whom European laws and customs were imposed (see \nMMF , at para.  67; Haida Nation , at para.  17). This is what  I will call justice linked to \nreconciliation or reconciliatory justice.  \n I hasten to add that the principle of the honour of the Crown is not a cause \nof action. It “speaks to how obligations that attract it must be fulfilled” ( MMF , at \npara.  73 (emphasis in  original)). The honour of the Crown is a constitutional principle \nthat “looks forward to reconciliation between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples in an \nongoing, ‘mutually respectful long -term relationship’” ( Desautel , at para.  30, quoting \nBeckman , at para.  10, and citing Mikisew Cree , at para.  21; Newfoundland and \nLabrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani -Utenam) , \n2020 SCC 4, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 15, at paras.  21 and 28).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n \n \n This body of jurisprudence, which is well established, forms p art of the \n“jus commune ” to which the Preliminary Provision of the Civil Code  refers . The Court \nhas previously determined that this “ jus commune ” is not limited to private law but \nmust be understood in an expansive manner so as to give the Civil Code  “the broadest \npossible operational scope” ( Prud’homme , at para.  29, citing A. -F. Bisson, “La \nDisposition préliminaire du Code civil du Québec ” (1999), 44 McGill L.J.  539). More \nspecifically, the honour of the Crown and the obligations flowing from it are part of the \npublic law governing the liability of the State. As author Daniel Jutras observes, \n[TRANSLATION ] “[i]t is public law that determines in what circumstances, and under \nwhat conditions, the State may be held liable” (“Regard sur la common law au Québec : \nperspective et cadrage” (2008), 10 R.C.L.F.  311, at p.  315; see also  Prud’homme , at \nparas.  24-27; Finney v. Barreau du Québec , 2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at \npara.  27). \n In this regard, the core of the analysis rests on art.  1376 C.C.Q. , which “is \na public law” rule ( Prud’homme , at para.  27). According to art.  1376 C.C.Q. , the rules \nin Book Five (“Obligations”) of the Civil Code  apply to the State, “subject to any other \nrules of law which may be applicable to [it]”, whether these other rules are writt en or \nunwritten (see Commentaires du ministre de la Justice , vol.

Société de transport de Montréal , 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. \n335, at para.  106), for example by creating a form of immunity in favour of the State \n(see, e.g., Ressources Strateco inc. v. Procureure générale du Québec , 2020 QCC A 18, \n32 C.E.L.R. (4th) 231, at para.  67). These rules can also change the nature of the State’s \nprivate law obligations, or even intensify them. Author Daniel Jutras helpfully observes \nthat this set of public law rules includes [ TRANSLATION ] “all rules th at give a distinct \nscope to [the] liability [of the State] because of the public nature of [its] activity” \n(“Cartographie de la mixité: la common law et la complétude du droit civil au Québec” \n(2009), 88 Can. Bar  Rev. 247, at p.  255).  \n I therefore agree wit h Bich  J.A.’s emphasis on the fact that art.  1376 \nC.C.Q.  is the provision that makes Quebec subject to private law obligations \n[TRANSLATION ] “without, however, releasing [it] from its public law obligations”, \nincluding those flowing from the honour of the Crown, “in .  . . its dealings with \nIndigenous peoples, even in contractual matters” (C.A. reasons, at paras.  128 and 130). \nHowever, in my respectful view, there is no basis for concluding that the principle of \nthe honour of the Crown is implicitly incorpor ated into contracts by operation of \nart. 1434 C.C.Q.  (see para.  130). The honour of the Crown applies to the contracts in \nthis case, but this does not mean that the obligations flowing from it are contractual \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n \n obligations in the strict sense. Good faith is part of the implicit content of a contract or \nat least reflects a [ TRANSLATION ] “general attitude” imposed on contracting parties by \nlaw (Lluelles and Moore, at No.  1977). But the honour of the Crown is binding on \nQuebec as a principle of public law that i s not part of the [ TRANSLATION ] “contractual \nmatrix” associated by law with the individual will of the parties (see Poitras v. \nConcession A25 , 2021 QCCA 1182, at para.  51). Unlike good faith under art.  1375 \nC.C.Q. , the obligations flowing from the honour o f the Crown are not contractual \nobligations that have binding force by reason of a validly formed contract between an \nIndigenous entity and the State. Moreover, the remedy for a breach of the obligations \nflowing from the honour of the Crown is not governed  by the rules of contractual \nliability or by the fundamental principle of restitutio in integrum . The honour of the \nCrown gives rise to public law obligations, anchored in the distinct logic of \nreconciliation (see G.  Motard and B.  Chartrand, “Négocier de b onne foi: les accords \ncommerciaux,",

Failure to comply with these obligations requires the \nCrown to restore the nation -to-nation relationship damaged b y the dishonourable \nconduct.  \n In sum, under art.  1376 C.C.Q. , the principle of the honour of the Crown \nand the obligations that flow from it are part of the “other rules of law” relating to the \ncivil liability of the State. These obligations intensify the State’s liability in the \ncircumstances where they apply. Consequently, while the honour of the Crown is \nengaged where the State has contractual obligations, its source, unlike those contractual \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n \n obligations, is firmly anchored in the public law rules that s upplement the legal regime \ngoverning the liability of the State.  \n I now turn my attention to the principles that guide the determination of \nwhether the honour of the Crown applies in particular situations.  \n The common element among the circumstances that the  Court has so far \nrecognized as engaging the honour of the Crown is that they relate to the reconciliation \nof specific Indigenous claims, rights or interests with the Crown’s assertion of \nsovereignty (see MMF , at para.  73). In particular, the Court has est ablished that the \nCrown has a duty to consult Indigenous peoples when their rights recognized and \naffirmed by s.  35 of the Constitution Act, 1982  might be adversely affected by the \nCrown’s conduct, whether the rights are established or claimed ( Tsilhqot’in  Nation v. \nBritish Columbia , 2014 SCC 44, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 257, at para.  78; Haida Nation , at \npara.  35). Where the Crown exercises control over specific Indigenous interests, the \nhonour of the Crown may give rise to a fiduciary obligation ( Wewaykum Indian B and \nv. Canada , 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras.  79 and 81; MMF , at para.  73). \nSimilarly, the Crown has an obligation to act with integrity in the negotiation, \ninterpretation and implementation of treaties entered into with Indigenous peoples \n(Restoule , at para.  73; Beckman , at para.  42). \n Some courts have recognized that the honour of the Crown may apply to \ncontractual undertakings that are not constitutional in nature and that also relate to \nreconciliation. For example, the Manitoba Court of Appe al held that a contract whose \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n \n purpose was to resolve claims by the Métis people that, up to that point, had not been \naddressed constructively and in good faith engaged the honour of the Crown ( Manitoba \nMetis Federation Inc. v. Brian Pallister , 2021 MBCA 47 , 458 D.L.R. (4th) 625). The \nOntario Superior Court of Justice approved an arbitration decision finding that the \nhonour of the Crown was engaged by a gaming revenue -sharing agreement because the \nagreement “represents the reconciliation of the constitutiona lly protected Aboriginal \nright of self -government .  . . with the Crown’s sovereignty” ( Ontario First Nations \n(2008) Limited Partnership v. Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation , 2020 ONSC \n1516, at para.  110). That decision was affirmed by the Court of App eal for Ontario, \nwhich found it unnecessary to address the question of the honour of the Crown (2021 \nONCA 592, at para.  75). \n Similarly, the jurisprudence recognizes that the principle of the honour of \nthe Crown applies to treaty land entitlement agreements  that are not themselves treaties \nprotected by s.  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982  (Saskatchewan (Attorney General) \nv.

Since their purpose is to rectify the Crown’s broken treaty \npromises ( Long Plain , at para.  117) and thus to promot e reconciliation ( Witchekan \nLake , at para.  127), such agreements are interpreted as engaging obligations flowing \nfrom the honour of the Crown. As these cases show, contracts are one of the instruments \navailable to governments for undertaking or continuing a process of reconciliation, in \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n \n addition to treaties ( Restoule , at paras.  68-70) and legislation ( Reference re An Act \nrespecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families , 2024 SCC 5 \n(“Reference ”), at paras.  20-21), even though reconcilia tion based on contract differs \nfrom reconciliation by treaty and from “legislative reconciliation”.  \n It is well settled that the Crown cannot contract out of its duty of \nhonourable dealing with Indigenous peoples ( Beckman , at para.  61). It follows, as \nBouch ard J.A. observed, that the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown \napply [ TRANSLATION ] “independently of the expressed or implied intention of the \nparties” and that this intention therefore cannot be a determinative consideration in the \nanalysis (C.A. reasons, at paras.  63 and 117, citing Beckman , at para.  61). It also \nfollows that the instrument employed by the Crown in its dealings, including a contract, \ncannot have the effect of excluding the obligations flowing from the honour of the \nCrown.  \n That being said, not every agreement between the Crown and an \nIndigenous group will necessarily engage the honour of the Crown. For example, \nsimple commercial contracts between a government and an Indigenous entity would \nnot necessarily engage the principle of the honour of the Crown. However, the Court’s \njurisprudence and the circumstances of this case point to a way of differentiating \nagreements in this regard.  \n First, the agreement in question must be entered into by the Crown and an \nIndigenous group by rea son and on the basis of the group’s Indigenous difference, \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n \n which reflects its distinctive philosophies, traditions and cultural practices ( Dickson v. \nVuntut Gwitchin First Nation , 2024 SCC 10, at para.  51, quoting Report of the Royal \nCommission on Aborigin al Peoples , vol.  2, Restructuring the Relationship (1996), at \np. 234).  \n It is well settled that the principle of the honour of the Crown rests on the \n“special relationship” between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. As in the case of an \nexplicit obligation o wed to an Indigenous group and enshrined in the Constitution, the \nhonour of the Crown is engaged only by an obligation assumed by the Crown on the \nbasis of its “special relationship” with the Indigenous group, which is different from \nthe one it has with th e population in general ( Mikisew Cree , at para.  21; Haida Nation , \nat para.  25). Moreover, the honour of the Crown will apply only if the contract has a \ncollective dimension. Agreements relating to individual rights, even if they are between \nthe State and a n Indigenous contracting party, will generally not engage the honour of \nthe Crown (see, e.g., Waldron v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2024 FCA 2, at para.  94, \nciting Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee (Grand Council)  v. McLean ,",

McLean , 2019 FCA 186, at paras.  8 and 11; \nWhapmagoostui First Nation v. McLean , 2019 FCA 187, at para.  11). \n Second, contractual agreements will engage the honour of the Crown \nwhere they relate to an Indigenous right of self -governme nt, whether the right is \nestablished or is the subject of a credible claim. In the case at bar, Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan argues that having an Indigenous police force is an exercise of its right of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n \n self-government. I therefore take care to limit my comm ents accordingly. While we do \nnot have to decide the question in order to resolve this case, I am not, however, \nexcluding the possibility of recognizing, in a different context, that other Indigenous \nrights or interests might also engage the honour of the Crown in connection with a \ncontractual undertaking.  \n It is not necessary, in order for the principle of the honour of the Crown to \napply, that an implicated Indigenous right already be recognized by the courts or the \nCrown.  \n In this regard, I do not agree wi th Canada that the honour of the Crown \nmay be engaged [ TRANSLATION ] “where the Crown makes an undertaking that is not \nconstitutional in nature for the implementation of the right of self -government protected \nby s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 ” (I.F., at para.  3 (emphasis added)). The Court \nhas never addressed the question of whether there is a right of self -government \nprotected by s.  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982  (Reference , at para.  112), and it is \nneither necessary nor appropriate to do so in this appeal.  \n Clearly, an established right, which is to say a right recognized by judicial \nauthority that is binding on the court, will suffice, but the same is true of a right that is \nthe subject of a credible claim. To arrive at this conclusion, I propose to draw on the \njurisprudence concerning the duty to consult. These cases plainly establish that a \ncredible claim to an Indigenous right is sufficient to impose an obligation on the Crown \nto deal honourably with Indigenous peoples ( Haida Nation , at para.  35; Rio Tinto Alcan \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n \n Inc. v. Carrier Sekani Tribal Council , 2010 SCC 43, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 650, at \nparas.  40-41). As McLachlin  C.J. wrote for a unanimous Court: “The threshold, \ninformed by the need to maintain the honour of the Crown, is not high  . . . While the \nexistence of a potential claim is essential, proof that the claim will succeed is not. What \nis required is a credible claim” ( Carrier Sekani , at para.  40). \n The application of the honour of the Crown in such circumstances is made \nnecessary by the  imperative of preserving the rights of Indigenous peoples on an \ninterim basis during the process of treaty negotiation and proof ( Haida Nation , at \npara.  27). In its intervener’s factum, Canada correctly points out that [ TRANSLATION ] \n“the honour of the Cro wn may give rise to obligations .  . . even where the existence of \na specific Indigenous right or interest has not been judicially affirmed” (I.F., at \npara.  17). \n The honour of the Crown advances the goal of reconciliation in particular \n“by promoting negotia tion and the just settlement of Aboriginal claims as an alternative \nto litigation and judicially imposed outcomes” ( Mikisew Cree , at para.  22, citing Taku \nRiver , at para.  24). This is a principle that is well established in the Court’s \njurisprudence (see, e.g., Haida Nation",

This is a principle that is well established in the Court’s \njurisprudence (see, e.g., Haida Nation , at para.  17; Mikisew Cree First Nation v. \nCanada (Minister of Canadian Heritage) , 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, at \npara.  51). For the purposes of this appeal, it is the existence of an  established right or a \ncredible claim to a righ t of self -government in a particular situation that justifies the \napplication of the principle of the honour of the Crown to some contracts and not to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n \n others. Such a right or claim serves to situate the contract in circumstances similar to \nthose that the C ourt has already recognized as engaging the honour of the Crown, \ncircumstances that, as we have seen, relate to specific Indigenous rights or interests and \ninvolve their reconciliation with the Crown’s assertion of sovereignty.  \n Having identified the test g overning the application of the principle of the \nhonour of the Crown in this case, I turn to an analysis of the tripartite agreements. It is \nthrough a characterization exercise that contracts engaging the honour of the Crown \nunder this test can be distingu ished, on the basis of their true legal nature, from those \nthat do not.  \n(b) Characterization of the Tripartite Agreements  \n While identifying which contracts engage the principle of the honour of the \nCrown is an exercise that relates to public law concepts, it i s helpful to draw inspiration, \nby analogy, from the exercise of characterizing contracts in the civil law, which serves \nto distinguish contracts on the basis of their legal category.  \n Unlike the process of interpretation, the characterization of a contract  in \nthe civil law is described as a [ TRANSLATION ] “legal exercise” (A.  Bénabent, Droit des \nobligations  (20th ed. 2023), at No.  294): its purpose is to identify the [ TRANSLATION ] \n“legal nature” of the contract in order to place it in the appropriate categor y that serves \nto determine the rules applicable to it (P.  Malinvaud, M.  Mekki and J. -B. Seube, Droit \ndes obligations  (15th ed. 2019), at No.  84). Agreements can thus be characterized on \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n \n the basis of what author Adrian Popovici helpfully calls their [ TRANSL ATION ] \n“characteristic prestation” ( La couleur du mandat  (1995), at p.  35, fn.  132). Transposed \nto this case, the question is whether the characteristic prestation of the tripartite \nagreements satisfies the test for the application of the principle of the honour of the \nCrown. As in private law, this characterization exercise is not governed strictly by the \nintention of the parties. Characterization is based on the legal nature of the act created \nand follows directly from the characteristic prestation of the  contract. It is a question \nof law, whereas the interpretation of a contract generally includes a significant factual \ndimension (Lluelles and Moore, at No.  1726).  \n In this case, the characteristic prestation of the tripartite agreements has \nthree aspects. F irst, the tripartite agreements provide for the establishment and \nmaintenance of an Indigenous police force. Second, they set out a shared funding \nregime between the governments of Canada and Quebec and Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan. Finally, they provide fo r the independent management of the police force \nby Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan.  \n In light of this characteristic prestation, it appears that the parties entered \ninto the tripartite agreements on the basis and by reason of Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan’s Indi genous difference. The Indigenous contracting party is the band \ncouncil, represented by its chief. The objective, as defined by the agreement, is to \nestablish and maintain the “Mashteuiatsh Police Force” formed under the Act. \n2024 SCC 39",

This section applies only to Indigenous \npolice forces, like all the sections in Division IV (of Chapter I of Title II) of the Act. \nSection 93 (as it read at the re levant time) provides that Indigenous police forces have \njurisdiction to maintain peace, order and public safety and to prevent and repress crime \nand offences under the laws and regulations applicable in the territory in which they \nare established. Accordi ng to s.  90 of the Act, only Indigenous communities may enter \ninto an agreement with Quebec to establish or maintain an Indigenous police force in a \nterritory determined under the agreement.  Under the applicable legislation, Quebec \ntherefore bound itself o n the basis and by reason of Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s \nIndigenous difference, with a view to meeting its needs as a community.  \n Moreover, if one is guided by the language used in the National Assembly \nby the Minister responsible for the Act, the tripart ite agreements were entered into in \nthe context of the nation -to-nation relationship between Quebec and the respondent. As \nQuebec acknowledges, non -Indigenous communities of a similar size in the province \ndo not benefit from the FNPP or have local police f orces. The aim of the funding is to \nremedy the historical harm resulting from the imposition of the national police on \nIndigenous peoples and the difficulties experienced by Indigenous communities in \nmanaging their internal security (see Policy , at p.  2; Journal des débats , at pp.  1252 -54 \n(S. Ménard)).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n \n \n Quebec is wrong to say that the tripartite agreements do not engage the \nhonour of the Crown because [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he action does not relate to a claim to \nan Aboriginal right or to a specific Indigenous in terest” (A.F., at para.  36). \n The honour of the Crown applies to the tripartite agreements because they \nconcern the Indigenous right of self -government claimed by the Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nFirst Nation in matters of public safety in the community. The purposes of the tripartite \nagreements are to establish and maintain an Indigenous police force and to determine \nits funding. While it is true that the entire population benefits from police services, the \nestablishment and maintenance of Indigenous police forces tha t are managed by the \ncommunities covered by an agreement and that provide culturally appropriate services \nto those communities distinguish these police forces from those serving the population \nin general.  \n As we have seen, Canada, Quebec and certain First N ations, including the \nPekuakamiulnuatsh, negotiated and entered into a broad -ranging agreement in principle \nthat was to serve as the basis for drafting a treaty “which shall be a land claims \nagreement and a treaty within the meaning of sections 25 and 35 o f the Constitution \nAct, 1982 ” (preamble, first recital). Section 2.1 of the agreement in principle states that \n“the Parties agree to ensure by way of treaty rather than by judicial means the \nrecognition, confirmation and continuation of the aboriginal righ ts of the First Nations \n. . ., including aboriginal title, and not their extinguishment”. Chapter 8 of the \nagreement in principle deals with self -government by the First Nations concerned, \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n \n authorizing them, among other things, to adopt their own constituti ons and enact their \nown laws on “any matter related to the organization, general welfare, development and \ngood government” of their communities, members and institutions (s.  8.3.1.1).

Chapter \n9, entitled “Administration of Justice”, gives the “legislative assemblies of the First \nNations” the right to enact laws “to constitute, maintain and organize police corps” \n(s. 9.4.1). The agreement in principle shows that the governments of Canada and \nQuebec consider Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s claim to self -governm ent in this area \nto be credible and that they take it seriously. Even if the right has not been established, \na credible claim is sufficient to engage the honour of the Crown.  \n Quebec’s power to enter into tripartite agreements derives from s.  90 of the \nAct. The legislative debates concerning the Act to amend the Police Act and the Act \nrespecting police organization as regards Native police  indicate that the Police Act  was \namended in order to promote self -government for Indigenous peoples. In those debates, \nthe Minister of Public Security stated, among other things, that the National Assembly \nhad urged the government to enter into [ TRANSLATIONS ] “agreements on various \nsubjects assuring them the exercise of the right of self -government in Quebec” with the \nnations that so wished, that “Indigenous nations have the right, under the laws of \nQuebec, to govern themselves on the lands allotted to them”, and that they “have the \nright to have and to control, under agreements with the government, institutions that \nsuit t heir needs in the areas of culture, education, language, health, social services and \neconomic development” ( Journal des débats , at p.  1252). It is clear from reading those \ndebates that it was in the context of the claim by Indigenous peoples to the right o f \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n \n self-government and control over their institutions that Quebec made the necessary \namendments to the Police Act  to make it possible for First Nations to have a culturally \nappropriate police force.  \n During the hearing before this Court, Quebec pointed out that the tripartite \nagreements contain a clause stipulating that the agreement [ TRANSLATION ] “shall not \nserve to recognize, define, affect, limit or create Aboriginal rights or treaty rights” and \n“shall not be interpreted to be an agreement or treaty withi n the meaning of section 35 \nof the Constitution Act, 1982 ” (cl.  1.4.1). I also note that the respondent is not seeking, \nthrough this litigation, to establish a right protected by s.  35 of the Constitution Act, \n1982 , including a right of self -government in matters of policing.  \n These facts are true, but they make no difference to the characterization of \nthe contract. Even though the parties have agreed that there will be no final resolution \nof Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s claims through the tripartite agreements, the fact \nremains that these agreements relate to the subject -matter of its claims, that is, its \nclaimed right of self -government in matters of internal security. The question is not \nwhether the agreement recognizes or modifies Indigenous rights , but only whether it \nrelates to this claimed right. On this point, I agree with the Attorney General of Canada \nthat [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he existence of the right does not have to be determined; it is \nenough that this right and its implementation are suffici ently at stake” (I.F., at para.  17). \n Quebec argues that there is no link between the provision of police services \nand the reconciliation of the specific rights and interests of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh as \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n \n an Indigenous people (A.F., at para.  36). That positio n mistakenly disregards the fact \nthat the tripartite agreements concern the maintenance of an Indigenous police force, \nwhich means that, for the reasons set out above, they relate to a claimed Indigenous \nright. Quebec admits that the honour of the Crown is  engaged [ TRANSLATION ] “in \nmatters involving [the] collective rights” of Indigenous peoples (para.  29). This is the \ncase here.

Quebec admits that the honour of the Crown is  engaged [ TRANSLATION ] “in \nmatters involving [the] collective rights” of Indigenous peoples (para.  29). This is the \ncase here. Moreover, the link between reconciliation and the agreements is plain from \ns. 90 of the Act, the statutory provision that authori zes the making of the agreements. \nCounsel for the appellant conceded this point herself, stating the following at the \nhearing: [ TRANSLATION ] “. . . section 90 of the Police Act  is, in our view, a \nreconciliation provision”; “it allows for, it facilitates, i t promotes reconciliation .  . . of \ncourse, that it’s what the governments wish” (transcript, day 1, at p.  47). I agree with \nQuebec on this point.  \n It is therefore clear that the purpose of the tripartite agreements under \nconsideration is to reconcile the Cr own’s assertion of sovereignty and the prior \npresence of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh on the territory concerned. The evidentiary record \nshows that the need of Indigenous peoples for culturally appropriate police services \noriginates in the difficult, and at times  even traumatizing, relationship that Indigenous \npeoples had, and in some cases continue to have, with the police services imposed on \nthem over the years by the Crown. These difficulties and the resulting traumas are well \ndocumented. The final reports of t he National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered \nIndigenous Women and Girls ( Reclaiming Power and Place  (2019)), the Viens \nCommission  and the Ipperwash Inquiry (2007) , among others, provide a \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n \n comprehensive account of them. Those reports refer in particular to  the failure of police \nservices to address violence against women and children in certain Indigenous \ncommunities, the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in detention centres, and \nracism and discrimination in the provision of services in certain commun ities. The \nopportunity to enter into agreements whose objective is to ensure the provision of \nculturally appropriate police services managed by the Indigenous communities served \ncontributes to reconciliation by ensuring that these services meet their needs . \n To conclude on this point, the tripartite agreements must be characterized \nas contracts that engage the honour of the Crown, because they were entered into with \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, on behalf of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh, for the \nestablishment and ma intenance of an Indigenous police force. These agreements are \nintended to promote reconciliation by allowing for the provision of services that are \nculturally adapted to the needs of the First Nation and anchored in its claim to \nself-government in matters of internal security. I will now consider the obligations that \nflow from the honour of the Crown in this context.  \n(c) Obligation Flowing From the Honour of the Crown  \n Because it is not a cause of action itself, the principle of the honour of the \nCrown is expres sed through the specific obligations to which it gives rise ( Restoule , at \npara.  220; MMF , at para.  73; Haida Nation , at para.  18). The content of these \nobligations varies with the circumstances. On the basis of this Court’s teachings with \nrespect to treati es, I am of the view that the honour of the Crown imposes a duty on \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n \n Quebec to perform the tripartite agreements with honour and integrity. This duty alone \nis a sufficient basis for dismissing the appeal. Consequently, it is not necessary for the \npurposes o f this case to decide whether Quebec also had a sui generis  fiduciary \nobligation or an obligation to act with diligence in fulfilling any promise made.  \n In the context of treaty making and implementation, this Court has long \nrecognized the Crown’s obligatio n to negotiate, interpret and apply treaties with honour \nand integrity while avoiding even the appearance of “sharp dealing” ( Haida  Nation , at \nparas.  19 and 42, quoting R. v. Badger , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para.  41). This \nobligation can be transposed to t he contractual context when this context also involves \nreconciliation between the Crown and Indigenous communities.  \n By this I do not mean to say that the agreement becomes a treaty like the \ntreaties protected by s.  35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .

This \nobligation can be transposed to t he contractual context when this context also involves \nreconciliation between the Crown and Indigenous communities.  \n By this I do not mean to say that the agreement becomes a treaty like the \ntreaties protected by s.  35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . Rather,  it is a matter of \nrecognizing that the honour of the Crown requires the Crown, in negotiating and \nperforming an agreement that has reconciliation as its backdrop, to meet a standard of \nconduct that is higher than in the context of an ordinary contractual relationship \n(Pallister , at para.  56; Witchekan Lake , at para.  130; see also Motard and Chartrand, at \np. 201).  \n The higher standard of conduct to which the Crown is subject creates \nobligations that are superimposed on contractual obligations. The content of  the \ncontract is determined by its provisions and by the obligations attaching to it under the \nprovisions of the Civil Code . Where the principle of the honour of the Crown applies, \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n \n not only is the content of the contract interpreted generously ( Badger , at para.  41), but \nan additional public law obligation is superimposed on the contractual obligations, \nnamely the Crown’s obligation to act with honour and integrity in performing the \ncontract. As this Court has observed in the treaty context, the honour of th e Crown \n“lead[s] to requirements such as honourable negotiation and the avoidance of the \nappearance of sharp dealing” ( MMF , at para.  73). In the contractual context, the honour \nof the Crown therefore does not change the terms of the agreement, but rather m odifies \nhow the obligations found therein are performed by requiring the Crown to act in a \nmanner that fosters reconciliation. The honour of the Crown imposes this additional \nobligation only on the Crown, not on the Indigenous group that is also a party to  the \ncontract.  \n What does it mean for the Crown to act with honour and integrity in \nnegotiating and performing an agreement? The cases in which this question has been \nconsidered in the treaty context are instructive.  \n When the Crown decides to enter into a contractual relationship that \nengages its honour, it must act honourably, with integrity and in such a way as to avoid \neven the appearance of “sharp dealing” ( Haida Nation , at para.  19; Badger , at para.  41). \nAs the expression “sharp dealing” suggests, this  standard of conduct demands more \nthan the mere absence of dishonesty. In particular, it requires the Crown not to adopt \nan intransigent attitude. The Crown must therefore come to the negotiating table with \nan open mind and with the goal of engaging in gen uine negotiations with a view to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n \n entering into an agreement. The Crown should not enter into negotiations without \nintending to keep its promises, nor should it attempt to coerce or unilaterally impose an \noutcome (A.  F. Martin and C.  Telfer, “The Impact of the Honour of the Crown on the \nEthical Obligations of Government Lawyers: A Duty of Honourable Dealing” (2018), \n41 Dal. L.J. 443, at p.  459). Similarly, the Crown cannot change its position for the sole \npurpose of delaying or ending negotiations ( Kaska Den a Council v. Canada , 2018 FC \n218, at para.  43). \n Of course, the honour of the Crown does not require that the negotiations \nultimately be successful; as is the case in any negotiation, either party may withdraw \nwhere an impasse is reached ( Chemainus First Na tion v. British Columbia Assets and \nLands Corp. , [1999] 3 C.N.L.R. 8  (B.C.S.C.), at para.  26). However, when it is \ninvolved in such a process, the Crown must adopt a standard of conduct higher than the \none it would adopt in the private law context and must act in such a way as to maximize \nthe chances of success.  \n Once an ag reement has been entered into, the Crown must conduct itself \nwith honour and integrity in performing its obligations. This means, among other \nthings, that it must construe the terms of the agreement generously and comply with \nthem scrupulously while avoidi ng any breach of them ( Bad",

This means, among other \nthings, that it must construe the terms of the agreement generously and comply with \nthem scrupulously while avoidi ng any breach of them ( Badger , at para.  41). The Crown \nmust act honourably in any negotiations to change or renew the agreement (see, e.g., \nGitanyow First Nation v. Canada , [1999] 3 C.N.L.R. 89  (B.C.S.C.)). It must avoid \ntaking advantage of the imbalance i n its relationship with Indigenous peoples by, for \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n \n example, agreeing to renew its undertakings on terms that are more favourable to it \nwithout having genuinely negotiated first (see F.  Hoehn, “The Duty to Negotiate and \nthe Ethos of Reconciliation” (2020), 83 Sask. L. Rev. 1, at p.  20). \n(d) Breach by Quebec of Its Obligation To Conduct Itself Honourably in \nPerforming the Agreements  \n Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan alleges that Quebec, through its \nintransigent attitude, acted dishonourably by refusing to negotiate the  funding terms of \nthe tripartite agreements, thereby imposing on it an arbitrary level of funding that \nQuebec knew was inadequate. Quebec counters that, if the honour of the Crown gives \nrise to obligations for it, then it conducted itself honourably becaus e it complied with \nits undertaking to fund the Mashteuiatsh police force in accordance with the \nagreements.  \n Quebec is mistaken. As discussed above in the section on good faith, \nQuebec refused to consider Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s repeated requests to \nrenegotiate the level of funding for its police force even though it knew that the police \nforce was underfunded and that the respondent would accept an inadequate level of \nfunding to avoid resorting to the SQ’s ill -adapted services.  \n That conduct, which amou nts to a breach of good faith, also represents a \nbreach of the obligation to perform the tripartite agreements with honour and integrity, \nwhich imposes a higher standard. In addition to prohibiting the Crown from defrauding \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n \n or misleading another party, the  honour of the Crown requires it to meaningfully \nengage in genuine negotiations in a manner conducive to maintaining a relationship \nthat can support the ongoing process of reconciliation between the Crown and \nIndigenous peoples (see Badger , at para.  41; Haida Nation , at para.  19; MMF , at \npara.  73; Chemainus , at para.  26). \n By refusing to renegotiate the level of funding despite Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan’s repeated complaints and the precarious situation in which it found itself, \nQuebec conducted itself in a manner that fell well below the standard of honourable \nconduct. Through its breach, Quebec jeopardized the contractual equilibrium and the \nvery purpose of the tripartite agreements. That conduct is not made less dishonourable \nby the fact that Quebec subs equently complied with the terms resulting from its refusal \nto negotiate.  \n Accordingly, I conclude that Quebec failed to comply with its obligation \nto act with honour, a breach that establishes a second independent basis of liability.  \nB. Appropriate Remedy  \n The appropriate remedy for the breaches found on these two grounds must \nnow be determined. Since Quebec’s conduct can be characterized as both a civil fault \nand a breach of a public law obligation, the appropriate remedy can be ordered in \naccordance with the Quebec civil law regime and the public law regime.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n \n \n Quebec recognizes, in its alternative argument, that an award of damages \nis an appropriate remedy in the civil law. However, it submits that the Court of Appeal \nerred in the analysis that led it to order Q uebec to pay Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \n$767,745.58, an amount corresponding to 48 percent of the accumulated deficits, along \nwith interest at the legal rate and the additional indemnity.

In particular, Quebec argues \nthat the Court of Appeal quantified th e damages in an arbitrary manner, including by \nfailing to determine whether the deficits were in fact the logical, direct and immediate \nconsequence of the alleged fault. In Quebec’s opinion, it is therefore necessary, if \ndamages are awarded, to remand the case to the Superior Court so that it can fix the \ndamages in accordance with the applicable principles and in light of the evidence that \nwill then be presented. Finally, it submits that, in this case at least, the same principles \ngovern an award of damages  for a breach of the obligations flowing from the honour \nof the Crown.  \n As for Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, it argues that both the rules of public \nlaw and those of the civil law “justify the reimbursement of the deficits” it had to \nassume, such that there is no reason to remand the case to the Superior Court (R.F., at \npara.  149).  \n In my view, Quebec is mistaken in arguing that the determination of the \nappropriate remedy in this case lends itself to the same analysis under the civil law and \nunder public law. Although these two legal regimes can be applied to the same \nwrongful conduct, as in this case, they differ in nature.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n \n \n The civil law regime is based on corrective justice; its aim is to place the \naggrieved party in the position it would have been in but for  the fault committed by \nanother. The injury must both be an immediate and direct consequence of that fault and \nhave been foreseen or foreseeable (arts.  1607 and 1613 C.C.Q. ). \n As for the public law regime associated with the principle of the honour of \nthe C rown, it is concerned instead with the long -term relationship between the Crown \nand Indigenous communities ( Haida Nation , at para.  32; Carrier Sekani , at \nparas.  37-38; K.  Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada  (2nd ed. (loose -leaf)), at \n§ 15:20; B.  Slattery, “Aboriginal Rights and the Honour of the Crown” (2005), 29 \nS.C.L.R.  (2d) 433, at p.  440). The court must order any measure that is necessary to \nrestore the honour of the Crown and thereby foster the goal of reconciliation ( Restoule , \nat para.  277, quot ing Haida Nation , at para.  45). This regime is much more flexible \nthan that of the civil law: courts can and must be creative in finding a remedy that \nadvances reconciliation ( Restoule , at para.  277, quoting Hogg and Dougan, at p.  292). \nI would add that th e high standard that applies to the honour of the Crown justifies, in \npart, the exercise of the courts’ discretion to grant a remedy they consider appropriate, \na discretion that does not exist under the good faith regime. In turn, this discretion \nmilitates  against the position of the intervener the Attorney General of Canada that the \nCourt of Appeal first had to consider issuing a declaration before it awarded damages \nagainst the governments of Canada and Quebec. Within the sphere of reconciliatory \njustice,  flexibility, not rigidity, is the rule.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n \n \n Since the two regimes do not have the same purpose and are not governed \nby the same rules, they do not lend themselves to the same analysis. For these reasons, \nI will examine the civil law regime and the public law regime in turn.  \n(1) Breach of Good Faith: Restitutio in Integrum  \n In the case of the civil law regime, I agree with Quebec that the quantum \nof damages cannot be established on the record before us.  \n After concluding that the conduct of the governments of Canada and \nQuebec gave rise to civil liability and, more specifically, constituted an abuse of right \n— a conclusion with which I agree — the Court of Appeal turned to the question of the \nremedy.

In this regard, it stated that [ TRANSLATION ] “in the present matter,  the \ncondemnation to pay damages that match the deficits incurred by [Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan] from 2013 -2018 to operate its police service (even if unsatisfactorily) is a \nfair and reasonable remedy corresponding to the injury resulting from the abuse,  which \nis a contractual fault” (para.  140).  \n Certainly, the obstinate refusal of the two governments, including that of \nQuebec, to negotiate the level of funding during the renewal process contemplated by \nthe very terms of the agreements constitutes a civil  fault. However, the respondent — \nthe plaintiff at first instance — also had the burden of proving exactly what injury \nresulted therefrom in order to support its claim in civil liability for breach of the \nrequirements of good faith. It is not clear that, e ven if Quebec had acted in good faith \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n \n during the negotiations, it would, with Canada, have provided 100 percent of the \nfunding for the SPM and the respondent would not have incurred any deficit; it is the \nvery essence of negotiations that a party will not necessarily obtain everything it \nwishes, particularly in a context such as this, where political will and the available \nfunds were limited. Similarly, it is not clear that the supplemental assistance provided \nby Quebec, whether through a contract addendum,  a bilateral agreement or a \nsecondment, is of no relevance in assessing the damages required to compensate for \nthe injury suffered by the respondent. Nor does the record show whether the \nnegotiations concerning the first agreement included in the period at  issue took place \nduring that period or before it, in which case the injury caused by the breach could not \nbe taken into account by the court. In my view, and with respect, the Court of Appeal \ncould not conclude, without a more thorough analysis of the evi dence, that the injury \nsuffered by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan as a result of the failure to comply with \narts. 6, 7 and 1375 C.C.Q.  corresponded to the full amount of the accumulated deficits.  \n In the circumstances, this Court is unable to carry out this as sessment itself. \nThe evidence concerning the injury suffered, and notably the relevance of the \ncontributions that Quebec seeks to document in its table DPGQ -21, makes this task a \nhazardous one on appeal. If Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s action were based s olely \non a civil fault, I would therefore find that the case should be remanded to the Superior \nCourt so that it can determine the quantum of damages ( Supreme Court Act , s. 46.1; \nSaadati v. Moorhead , 2017 SCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at para.  45). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n \n \n I turn n ow to the question of the appropriate remedy in respect of public \nlaw. \n(2) Breach of the Obligation To Act With Honour: Restoring the Honour of \nCrown  \n A breach of the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown makes \navailable “the full range of remedies, including damages and other coercive relief, .  . . \nto remedy that breach” ( Restoule , at para.  276, citing Roach, at §  15:2). Under the \npublic law regime, the analysis must be focused on restoring the honour of the Crown, \nwhich was marred by its wrongful co nduct. The purpose of this exercise is not to \nremedy the consequences of a civil fault, but rather to impose a measure that restores \nbalance to the relationship between the parties and thus places them back on the path \nto reconciliation.  \n Given that the exe rcise is concerned with the relationship between the \nCrown and Indigenous peoples, it is important to be sensitive to Indigenous \nperspectives on the manner in which the relationship can be restored.

In a leading text \non the subject, author Robert Mainville , now a justice of the Quebec Court of Appeal, \nwrote that “[f]ull consideration should be given to the Aboriginal perspective, and \nmeasures should be taken to ensure that the decisions made are consistent with the \nlong-term interests of the concerned Abori ginal community and with its survival as a \nviable, distinct culture and society” (p.  127). While these comments were made in the \ncontext of a discussion of court -supervised compensation schemes, they are also \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n \n helpful in determining the appropriate remedy f or a breach of an obligation flowing \nfrom the honour of the Crown. This does not mean that the representatives of an \nIndigenous community can themselves decide, in the court’s place, what remedy is \nappropriate in the circumstances. Rather, it is a matter o f recognizing that the \nIndigenous perspective in this regard is a factor that the court must take into account. \nThe more reasonable the Indigenous perspective is, the greater the likelihood that the \ncourt will accede to it.  \n On completing his analysis focus ed on the honour of the Crown, \nBouchard  J.A. ordered Quebec to pay Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan $767,745.58, \nwith interest at the legal rate and the additional indemnity, for its failure to comply with \nits obligation to act honourably in its contractual dea lings with the respondent (C.A. \nreasons, at para.  125).  \n Should this remedy be upheld?  \n In this case, the relationship between the parties was undermined by the \nintransigent attitude adopted by Quebec at the stage of renewing the tripartite \nagreements during  the period at issue. That attitude served Quebec’s interests. Quebec, \nwhich is responsible for ensuring the safety of everyone in the province, knew that the \nSQ’s services were ill -adapted to the realities of Indigenous communities and could \neven be harmf ul to them. By renewing the agreements without genuinely negotiating \ntheir funding terms, Quebec was able to give the community of Mashteuiatsh access to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 125 ---\n \n Indigenous policing while at the same time limiting its own expenditures and ensuring \nthat Canada cont inued to partially fund the police force.  \n As I mentioned above, Quebec’s intransigent attitude made \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan feel like there was a “knife to the throat” (C.A. reasons, \nat para.  101): either it continued to impoverish itself to maintain t he SPM and preserve \nthe progress that the SPM represented in terms of self -government, or it abolished the \nSPM, which meant both returning to the SQ’s inadequate services and suffering a \nsetback with respect to self -government (paras.  136-37). That “knife to the throat” was \nwhat made the respondent agree to renew the tripartite agreements on terms that it could \nnot genuinely negotiate, which led to it assuming deficits totalling $1,599,469.95 \nduring the period at issue. That state of affairs also forced the  SPM to operate “at the \nvery lowest of the lowest”, as its officers were not even trained in the use of traffic \nradar or breathalyzers (paras.  99 and 114). This meant that the quality of the services \nprovided to the community — and hence the community itse lf — suffered because of \nthe intransigence and the underfunding that resulted therefrom.  \n Thus, despite the “respect” and “transparency” noted by the trial judge — \nwho did not consider the principle of the honour of the Crown — Quebec’s attitude \nbenefited i t and harmed Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, not only in financial terms but \nalso from the standpoint of the quality of policing and its dignity, as its freedom of \nchoice was not respected. By imposing such a difficult choice on the respondent despite \nknowing  that the SQ’s services were ill -adapted and possibly harmful, Quebec did not \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n \n deal with it on an equal footing and did not display the [ TRANSLATION ] “spirit",

As an intervener, Canada takes no position \non the appropriate remedy in this case.  \n It is true, as noted for a unanimous Court by O’Bonsawin  J., that this \nremedy “is especially appropriate giv en the non -adversarial, trust -like relationship \nCanadian governments are supposed to have with Aboriginal people” ( Shot Both Sides \nv. Canada , 2024 SCC 12, at para.  72, quoting Roach, at §  15:31). A declaration helps \nparties resolve their dispute in a manner that is collaborative rather than conflictual and \nthat upholds their respective rights and obligations. A measure of this kind is more \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n \n likely to move them closer to the goal of reconciliation than a remedy imposed by the \ncourts following adversarial proceedings (see Reference , at para.  77; Desautel , at \npara.  87; Haida Nation , at para.  20; Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo -Services \nInc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para.  24). In MMF  and Shot Both Sides , \nthis Court found that a declaration that would assist the Indigenous party in future \nnegotiations with the Crown was a measure that would allow issues to be resolved in a \npractica l way and was therefore an appropriate remedy.  \n That being said, it is also true that other remedies, including an award of \ndamages, are available to a court ( Restoule , at para.  288; see also Carrier Sekani , at \npara.  37). The remedy relating to the honour o f the Crown will vary with the \ncircumstances of each case; no type of remedy takes precedence over the others. I \nreiterate that, from the start of the proceedings, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan has been \nclaiming damages for what it considers to be dishonoura ble conduct and that it has not \nasked for a declaration to be issued. This case thus differs from Shot Both Sides , in \nwhich the Indigenous party expressly sought such a declaration (para.  63). It should \nalso be noted that, before this Court, Quebec has not  challenged the fact that damages \nwere awarded as a remedy in this case; rather, it is their quantum that it disputes (A.F., \nat paras.  126-28). In this sense, the case can also be distinguished from Restoule , in \nwhich a government party argued that only a declaration was available to remedy the \nbreach in question (para.  269).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n \n \n Accordingly, I must now consider the quantum of damages relating to the \nhonour of the Crown and whether the case should be remanded to the Superior Court \nas suggested by Quebec.  \n With r egard to the quantum, I note that Quebec’s arguments on the question \nof damages are centred on the logic of contractual liability and corrective",

Quebec has made no argument concerning the damages \nawarded by Bouchard  J.A. further to his analysis relating to the principle of the honour \nof the Crown. Quebec says nothing about the function of damages as a remedy meant \nto repair its relationship with Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan. Nor does it say anything \nabout the specific nature of the remedy required for a breach of an obligation flowing \nfrom the honour of the Crown, or about what the author Mainville describes as a \n“special approach that ensures that the reconciliation of Aboriginal and mainstream \nCanadian societies can b e achieved in a context of fairness and justice for both \nsocieties” (p.  109).  \n While calculating the quantum of damages in accordance with the rules of \nthe civil law requires an assessment that the Court is not in a position to make, we are \nin an entirely d ifferent context here. The task is to determine the appropriate remedy \nfor a breach of an obligation flowing from the honour of the Crown; in this sense, a \ncourt’s analysis must instead be focused on reconciliatory justice to ensure that the \norder made wil l have the effect of restoring the honour of the Crown. Once again, I \nagree with Mainville, who explains in his text that “the use of the compensation monies \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n \n . . . should be consistent with the preservation of the honour of the Crown and with the \ninterests  of both present and future generations of the affected Aboriginal Peoples” \n(p. 127). As this Court recognized in Restoule , courts must be creative in determining \nthe appropriate remedy where this is necessary to restore the honour of the Crown \n(para.  277). \n The correct amount to be awarded as damages for a breach of an obligation \nflowing from the honour of the Crown is a highly contextual issue. In this case, I am of \nthe view that the amount determined by the Court of Appeal should be upheld given \nthe parti cular circumstances of the case, having regard to the purpose of the damages, \nwhich serve not only to compensate for past injury but also to restore the honour of the \nCrown for the future. To this can be added the difficulty of quantifying the financial \ninjury sustained by Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan and the relevance, in light of the \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown, of the additional financial contributions provided \nby Quebec in this case. Moreover, remanding the case to the Superior Court for this \nsort of assessment — as opposed to an assessment of the damages related solely to civil \nfault — would, in my opinion, be contrary to the principle of proportionality that must \nguide the courts as an organizing principle of the law of civil procedure.  \n As a re sult of Quebec’s conduct, the respondent was deprived of the \nopportunity to negotiate more favourable funding terms with the Government of \nQuebec, which resulted in recurring deficits related to the operating costs of the \nMashteuiatsh police force. It is n ot possible to determine the position the respondent \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n \n would be in today but for the Crown’s dishonourable conduct. However, since it is the \nCrown’s dishonourable conduct itself that makes this impossible, Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan should not be penalized.  The other injury caused to it, from the standpoint \nof the quality of policing and its dignity, is also difficult to quantify with any precision.  \n The supplemental assistance provided by Quebec during the period at issue \ndoes not call into question the reme dy awarded by the Court of Appeal. In fact, those \nadditional resources did not actually remedy the injury sustained by \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan and its community in terms of finances, the quality of \npolicing or respect for their dignity, nor did they se rve to restore the relationship \nbetween the parties; rather, their effect was to prevent the SPM from being abolished \nwhile perpetuating its precarious situation and the consequences thereof.  \n The witnesses for Canada and Quebec acknowledged that their \ncontributions",

At trial, Canada’s representative, \nMr. Bourdage, described the $400,000 in supplemental assistance provided by Canada, \nan amount that corresponded to the supplemental assistance provided by Quebec at the \nsame time, as a “Band -Aid” or [ TRANSLATION ] “small bandage” that would “buy a little \ntime” or “stem the bleeding” in order to “keep the lights on a bit longer” and “prevent \nthe police station from closing” (A.R., vol.  XVII, at p.  9). He continued by stating that \nCana da [ TRANSLATION ] “wanted to avoid putting money directly on the salary item \nbecause .  . . there was, after all, some reluctance to commit [to maintaining that level \nof funding]” ( ibid.). Similarly, his colleague from Quebec stated that Quebec wanted \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n \n to pro vide additional support to Indigenous communities that needed it, [ TRANSLATION ] \n“but not with salaries, for the reasons [Mr.  Bourdage] explained .  . . in his testimony” \n(p. 66). These excerpts clearly show that the supplemental assistance was not intended \nto actually remedy the injury caused by the dishonourable conduct of the federal and \nprovincial governments nor to restore the relationship with the respondent, but rather \nto maintain the SPM without providing any meaningful solutions to the persistent \nproblems resulting from that conduct.  \n In short, given the magnitude of the injury caused to Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nTakuhikan and the community it represents and given the relatively modest nature of \nits claim, I see no reason to vary the Court of Appeal’s order so  as to take into account \nthe supplemental assistance provided by Quebec, which helped ensure the SPM’s \ncontinued existence without, however, rectifying its precarious situation or repairing \nthe relationship between the parties.  \n I would also note that it is  essential to pay particular attention to \nproportionality when a breach of an obligation flowing from the honour of the Crown \nis in issue. In such circumstances, the path to restoring the honour of the Crown does \nnot always involve the strict application o f private law principles. Nor does it always \nrequire insistence on following procedures that are burdensome, given the amount at \nstake, in order to establish the consequences of dishonourable conduct. Reconciliatory \njustice requires both adaptability and f lexibility. This is an example of where a “culture \nshift” calls upon judges to manage the legal process “in line with the principle of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n \n proportionality” ( Hryniak  v. Mauldin , 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para.  32; see \nCode of Civil Procedure , CQLR, c.  C-25.01,  art. 18). \n It seems clear to me that the circumstances of this case raise issues of \nproportionality. In my view, the ends of justice — which here means reconciliatory \njustice — would not be served by remanding the case to the Superior Court. The de ficits \nare not attributable to any mismanagement of the SPM. They have been accumulating \nfor more than a decade, and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan initiated these proceedings \nin December 2017, about seven years ago. It has already devoted an enormous amount \nof time and effort to asserting its rights under the tripartite agreements. Remitting the \ncase to the trial court would add to the delays already experienced by the respondent \n(and Quebec) without any clear indication that the judge would arrive at a diffe rent \nquantum. In these circumstances, and given the amount at stake, it would not be in the \ninterests of justice to prolong the process any further.  \n In light of their distinct purposes, one cannot exclude the possibility that \nthe private law remedy and the public law remedy could complement one another.

I \nwould note, however, that the determination of the quantum of damages awarded for a \nbreach of the obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown should take into \naccount any remedies granted concurrently under private law, notably in order to avoid \ndouble compensation (see, by analogy, Vancouver (City) v. Ward , 2010 SCC 27, [2010] \n2 S.C.R. 28, at par a. 36). It is true that the distinct nature of a claim for a breach of the \nobligation associated with the honour of the Crown means that this public law remedy \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n \n is not a complete substitute for that of private law. However, as authors Jean -Louis \nBaudouin, P atrice Deslauriers and Benoît Moore observe regarding the remedy under \ns. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the State may nonetheless \nargue in defence that the private law remedy is capable of sufficiently addressing the \nbreach ( La resp onsabilité civile  (9th ed. 2020), at No.  1-140, citing Ward , at \nparas.  34-35). That being so, I note that upholding the amount awarded by the Court of \nAppeal for breach of the honour of the Crown is determinative of the outcome of the \nappeal in this case.  \n In the end, I would rely on the flexibility inherent in the assessment of \ndamages in this public law context and uphold, without interfering with the quantum, \nthe remedy granted by the Court of Appeal, which is more conducive than any other \nmeasure to rest oring the honour of the Crown. The grounds that have led me to find a \nbreach by Quebec and to uphold the award made against it by the Court of Appeal \nsuffice to identify Quebec’s dishonourable conduct and to provide the parties with \nguidance for the future . For these reasons, and in light of the compensation awarded to \nPekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, I am of the view that a declaration would be of no \npractical utility in this case (see Shot Both Sides , at para.  68). \n In upholding the remedy granted by the Court  of Appeal, I am not taking it \nupon myself to “rewrite” the tripartite agreements. I am sensitive to the argument put \nforward by the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, relying, inter alia , on Witchekan \nLake , at paras.  127-31, that the honour of the Crown sh ould not be used to add to a \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n \n contract, as an implied obligation, a “hitherto unknown constitutional funding \nobligation” that would conflict with the terms freely agreed upon by the parties (I.F., \nat para.  35). I am mindful of the fact that the honour of th e Crown speaks to how \nagreements are to be carried out and is not a cause of action itself ( MMF , at para.  73). \nAccordingly, I share the view expressed by Rennie  J.A. in Witchekan Lake : even when \nthe honour of the Crown applies to a contract, the court’s ro le cannot be “to rewrite, \nunder the guise of reconciliation, the bargain struck” (para.  131).  \n That is certainly not what I propose to do here.  \n I would not interfere with the Government of Quebec’s contractual \nundertaking to fund the police force up to a “ maximum amount” set for each fiscal year \n(cl. 4.2.1) or with Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan’s contractual undertaking to assume \nresponsibility for the deficits accumulated during the same period (cl.  4.5.2). Here, the \nremedy sought and granted by the Court of  Appeal is intended to allow the endeavour \nof maintaining an Indigenous police force in Mashteuiatsh to regain momentum within \na nation -to-nation relationship that is renewed for the future, and in accordance with \nthe constitutional principle of reconcilia tion. In my view, this appears entirely \nappropriate.  \n The relationship between the Crown and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan is",

In my view, this appears entirely \nappropriate.  \n The relationship between the Crown and Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan is \nongoing. As the Court stated in Taku River , “[i]n all its dealings with Aboriginal \npeoples, the Crown must act honourably, in accorda nce with its historical and future  \nrelationship with the Aboriginal peoples in question” (para.  24 (emphasis added)). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n \n Quebec will be expected to conduct itself honourably in the future when carrying out \nsimilar agreements, in keeping with the principles la id down in this judgment.  \nVI. Conclusion  \n For all these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs.  \n The respondent brought a motion to adduce new evidence. The motion, \nwhich was referred to the panel by a judge of the Court, is contested by Quebec. Given \nthat I would dismiss the appeal irrespective of this exhibit, I consider the motion to be \nmoot. I would therefore dismiss it, but without costs.  \n The respondent also asked this Court to award costs against Quebec on a \nsolicitor -client basis. It argues that t he appeal represents an exceptional circumstance \nbecause it had to [ TRANSLATION ] “prolong legal proceedings to have the Appellant’s \nfailure .  . . sanctioned despite the fact that the Intervener [the Attorney General of \nCanada] did not seek to appeal the ju dgment sanctioning their concerted actions” (R.F., \nat para.  159). It says that following the usual rule would be contrary to the purposes of \nreconciliation.  \n I cannot accept those arguments. In my opinion, this case does not involve \nexceptional circumstance s within the meaning of the case law on costs. In exercising \nits discretion, the Court awards costs on a solicitor -client basis where a party has \ndisplayed “reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous” conduct or where an appeal raises \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n \n issues of general import ance that go beyond the particular case of the successful party \nin the appeal (see, e.g., Montréal (City) v. Octane Stratégie inc. , 2019 SCC 57, [2019] \n4 S.C.R. 138, at para.  95). Here, there are no such circumstances that would justify \nexercising our discretion. There is nothing to suggest that Quebec acted in a \nreprehensible, scandalous or outrageous manner in connection with these judicial \nproceedings. Likewise, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan has not shown that it has “no \npersonal, proprietary or pecuni ary interest in the litigation that would justify the \nproceedings on economic grounds” or “that it would not have been possible to \neffectively pursue the litigation in question with private funding” ( Carter v. Canada \n(Attorney General) , 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para.  140; see also Anderson \nv. Alberta , 2022 SCC 6, at para.  73).

Comments on the Remedy  317 \nIV. Conclusion  \n 325 \n \nI. Overview  \n Do the principle of good faith and the principle of the honour of the Crown \nallow a court to disregard or ignore certain express clauses of a contract — and in fact, \nto go completely against those clauses, by imposing obligations that are inconsistent \nwith their unambiguous terms, when no a nnulment is sought and no defect of consent \nis alleged? That is the question at issue in this case.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n \n \n Under the tripartite agreements2 entered into over the years with the \ngovernments of Canada and Quebec, the respondent, Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan \n(“Takuhi kan”), the political and administrative organization of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh \nInnu First Nation, is responsible for police services for that First Nation, which is \nlocated in Mashteuiatsh near Roberval. These agreements govern the funding of the \npolice for ce, the Sécurité publique de Mashteuiatsh, and various aspects of the police \nforce’s operation, but limit in express terms the governments’ contribution to a \nmaximum amount determined each year, according to the budget allocated through \nbudgetary appropria tions. Pursuant to the agreements, Takuhikan is responsible for \ndeficits incurred in excess of the financial contribution that the governments wish to \nprovide, and it is also specified in these same agreements that the governments are not \nresponsible for u ndertakings given by Takuhikan in relation to the agreements (see \nart. 5.4.1).  \n Since the entering into of the first agreement in 1996 and the establishment \nof the Sécurité publique de Mashteuiatsh, the police force has incurred deficits in \ncertain years. C onsequently, and as provided for in the agreements, Takuhikan \nregularly drew from its program funds and own -source revenue to cover the \naccumulated deficits — namely, in the 2004 -2005, 2006 -2007 and 2012 -2013 fiscal \nyears. Takuhikan applied to the Superior  Court to have Canada and Quebec held liable \nfor the deficits accumulated for the police services provided under the agreements \n                                                 \n2 Unless otherwise indicated, the specific references in these reasons are references to the 2015 -2016 \ntripartite agreement (reproduced  in A.R., vol.  III, at p.  58). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n \n entered into between 2013 and 2017, alleging that they breached their obligations to \nnegotiate in good faith, act honourably and  meet the strict standards of conduct \nincumbent upon a fiduciary. The Superior Court dismissed Takuhikan’s application. \nHowever, the Court of Appeal found the governments liable for all of the deficits, \nconcluding that their refusal to fund the police forc e in a manner that guaranteed a level \nof service equal to that provided to non‑Indigenous communities was a breach of the \nhonour of the Crown. Only the Attorney General of Quebec is before the Court today \non appeal.  \n There is no doubt that this appeal raise s a very important issue for \nIndigenous peoples with respect to their quest for self -government, namely, that of \nproviding their own public security and personal safety services to Indigenous \npopulations. Financial support from Canada and Quebec for the es tablishment and \nmaintenance of Indigenous police services unquestionably contributes to achieving this \nobjective.  \n I have had the benefit of reading my colleague’s reasons, and I agree with \na number of his statements.

I am of the opinion that the principle of the honour of the \nCrown cannot be ignored when governments enter into tripartite agreements pursuant \nto the Police Act , CQLR, c.  P-13.1 (“ PA”) to fund Indigenous police services such as \nthose at issue here, even though it is expressly stated that these agreements are not \nsubject to s.  35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Such agreements are not purely \ncommercial contracts. In negotiating and entering into the tripartite agreements, \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n \n Canada and Quebec wished to make a commitment to Takuhikan with a goal of \nreconciliation. In my view, the principle of the honour of the Crown, just like the \nprinciple of good faith, is engaged in the assessment of the non -Indigenous contracting \nparty’s conduct, conduct that must, however, be analyzed in light of the undertakings \nas given. Indeed, it is important to specify that the principle of the honour of the Crown \ncannot serve as a basis for rewriting this type of agreement, nor does it allow the express \nclauses of the agreement to be ignored.  \n I do not, however, share my colle ague’s view concerning the scope of the \ncontractual undertakings agreed to by Takuhikan and Quebec, and I disagree with his \nconclusions on the alleged breaches of contractual good faith and of the principle of \nthe honour of the Crown. Like Bich  J.A. in her  concurring reasons in the Court of \nAppeal, I am of the opinion that the honour of the Crown and the obligations flowing \ntherefrom are implicitly incorporated into the tripartite agreements by operation of \nart. 1434 of the Civil Code of Québec (“C.C.Q. ”). However, that provision does not \npermit the introduction of an implied obligation that would be inconsistent with the \nterms of the contract ( Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp.  v. Hydro -Québec , 2018 SCC \n46, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 101, at para.  74). In this case, Que bec undertook to contribute \nfinancially to the establishment and maintenance of the Sécurité publique de \nMashteuiatsh through maximum financial contributions expressly agreed to by the \nparties. Quebec did not undertake to pay all of the costs incurred, or to fund services \nequal to those provided in communities in the region. It is in light of the scope of this \nundertaking that Quebec’s conduct toward Takuhikan must be assessed.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n \n \n With respect, finding Quebec liable for the deficits accumulated by \nTakuhikan in  this case signifies rewriting the express terms of the tripartite agreements \nto impose obligations that are contrary to the agreements. The principle of the honour \nof the Crown cannot justify this.  \n Furthermore, the mere fact that Quebec knew that the gove rnment \ncontributions were not sufficient to cover all of the actual costs incurred by Takuhikan \ndoes not mean that there was any fault in the renewal of the agreements. The trial judge, \nwho had the opportunity to examine the evidence in depth and to hear t estimony, \nconcluded that Takuhikan knew, as of 2008, that the level of funding offered by Quebec \ncould not cover all of the costs generated by the quality of the services that it wished to \nprovide to members of the community. The obligation to negotiate in  good faith does \nnot require agreeing to every request made by a counterparty, Indigenous or not, during \nthe negotiation of the initial contract or during its renewal. The refusal to agree to those \nrequests is not, in itself, indicative of a breach of the obligation to negotiate in good \nfaith or indicative of dishonourable conduct. The evidence shows that Quebec listened \nattentively to its counterparty’s grievances and was flexible in seeking solutions to the \nunderfunding problem. The additional financial a ssistance Quebec provided to \nTakuhikan in the course of their contractual relationship must be considered in \nassessing both Quebec’s conduct and the injury that could result from it. There is no \nevidence of any right provided for in the agreements that Que bec would have abused. \nThere is no basis for concluding that Quebec breached its obligation to negotiate in \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n \n good faith, either when the",

Facts and Procedural Context  \n Generally speaking, I agree with my colleague’s summary of the facts and \nof the judicial history. However, I wo uld clarify a few things to help circumscribe the \nissue raised before this Court.  \n First, a few words should be said about the choice of the proceeding \ninstituted by Takuhikan to claim the deficits accumulated in respect of the maintenance \nof its police for ce. \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 143 ---\n \n \n There was no dispute by Canada and Quebec that the First Nations Policing \nProgram (“FNPP”), which relies largely on funding from the federal government, \nsuffers from a generalized problem of underfunding. Clearly, this underfunding \nundermines the ambit ious objectives of the First Nations Policing Policy  (1996)  \n(“Federal Policy ”). \n In reaction to this underfunding, Takuhikan instituted two proceedings: the \none before us, and a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission on behalf \nof the chief of the  Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation, Gilbert Dominique, in which he \nalleged having experienced adverse differential treatment in the course of the \nimplementation of the Federal Policy and the FNPP, treatment resulting from the \ninadequate funding provided, the short duration of the agreements and the level of the \npolice services provided to members of the community. The complaint was dealt with \nby the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (“CHRT”), which separated the matter in two, \ndeciding to first rule on whether th ere was any discrimination and then, if so, to \ndetermine the appropriate remedy. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the CHRT found \nthat Mr.  Dominique’s complaint was substantiated ( Dominique (on behalf of the \nmembers of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation) v . Public Safety Canada , 2022 CHRT \n4). The Attorney General of Canada filed an application for judicial review of the \nCHRT’s decision with the Federal Court pursuant to s.  18.1 of the Federal Courts Act , \nR.S.C.  1985, c.  F-7. On February  27, 2023, Gagné  A.C. J. dismissed the application for \njudicial review ( Canada (Attorney General) v. Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation , 2023 \nFC 267). The Attorney General of Canada appealed that decision to the Federal Court \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n \n of Appeal. The matter was heard on February  20, 2024, an d at the conclusion of the \nhearing, it was taken under reserve. A decision has yet to be rendered.  \n In the present case, Takuhikan chose to bring a contractual claim for \ndamages. In its amended originating application, Takuhikan accused Canada and \nQuebec of  having [ TRANSLATION ] “breached their obligations to negotiate in good \nfaith, act with honour and discharge their fiduciary duties .  . . for the maintenance and \nfunding of police services for [its] territory” (A.R., vol.  I, at p.  137, para.  11). \nTakuhikan did not apply to have the agreements annulled or to have certain clauses in \nthe agreements declared abusive; it instead argues that the government parties are \nresponsible for all of the deficits accumulated.",

I, at p.  137, para.  11). \nTakuhikan did not apply to have the agreements annulled or to have certain clauses in \nthe agreements declared abusive; it instead argues that the government parties are \nresponsible for all of the deficits accumulated. In its view, the tripartite agreements \nmust be r ead as providing for the sharing between Canada and Quebec of all of the \ncosts required to maintain a level of service equal to that provided in communities in \nthe region, in accordance with the Federal Policy and the FNPP. The government \nparties’ failure to take the measures required to fund such a level of service therefore \nconstitutes, in Mashteuiatsh’s opinion, a breach of both the obligation to negotiate in \ngood faith and the principle of the honour of the Crown.  \n At no time has Takuhikan alleged that t he Pekuakamiulnuatsh Innu First \nNation has an inherent right of self -government in respect of police services under s.  35 \nof the Constitution Act, 1982 . To date, Takuhikan is also not a signatory of a treaty \nwithin the meaning of that provision, although a  negotiation process was initiated in \nthe course of which its jurisdiction over public security was recognized (see the general \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n \n agreement in principle of March  31, 2004, reproduced in R.R., at p.  72). Takuhikan has \nalso not raised any consideration relatin g to the right to equality to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the relevant provisions of the PA or to contest the alleged \nunderfunding of Mashteuiatsh’s police force by Quebec.  \n Takuhikan also submits that the 2013 to 2017 tripartite agreements were \nimposed by the government parties for 12 -month terms, with no possibility of \nnegotiation, and that when the agreements were renewed, the increase given by Canada \nand Quebec was insufficient to meet its real needs and legitimate expectations. It \nfollows, ac cording to Takuhikan, that the government parties, by refusing to increase \nthe funding, despite its repeated requests, breached both the obligation to negotiate in \ngood faith and the principle of the honour of the Crown.  \n I pause here to note that this appe al is not the appropriate vehicle for \nchallenging the insufficient funding of Indigenous policing provided through the \nFNPP. A contractual action like the one brought in this case must not be turned into an \naction seeking to sanction a discretionary policy  decision concerning the allocation of \nthe state’s budgetary resources, thereby disregarding the separation of powers ( Ontario \nv. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario , 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at \nparas.  27-31). In this context, the Court cannot allow an action brought by Takuhikan \nthat would in reality challenge the public policy choices of Canada and Quebec.  \n The trial judge rejected the interpretation of the tripartite agreements \nproposed by Takuhikan (2019 QCCS 5699). In contrast, the Court of Appeal, per \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n \n Bouchard  J.A., found that Canada and Quebec [ TRANSLATION ] “solemnly undertook to \nfund [Mashteuiatsh’s] police services at a level comparable to that of ‘communities \nwith similar conditions in the region’” by entering into the tripartite agreeme nts, and \nthus concluded in favour of Takuhikan (2022 QCCA 1699, at para.  74). For her part, \nBich  J.A. expressed the view that Quebec’s conduct constituted not only a breach of a \nconstitutional obligation to act with honour, as was found by Bouchard  J.A., b ut also, \nconcurrently, an abuse of contractual rights by operation of art.  1434 C.C.Q.  The judges \nof the Court of Appeal all concluded that such findings paved the way for an award of \ndamages that matched the deficits accumulated during the 2013 -2018 perio d. \nIII. Analysis  \nA.

The judges \nof the Court of Appeal all concluded that such findings paved the way for an award of \ndamages that matched the deficits accumulated during the 2013 -2018 perio d. \nIII. Analysis  \nA. The Principle of the Honour of the Crown Is Implicitly Incorporated Into the \nTripartite Agreements  \n This appeal raises, for the first time in this Court, the issue of whether the \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown is engaged in the context of the negotiation and \nimplementation of tripartite agreements for the funding of Indigenous police services. \nIn particular, the issue is whether the principle of the honour of the Crown is engaged \nin the context of contractual agreements between an Indigenou s community, Canada \nand Quebec. In addition, there is the fact that the parties have acknowledged that these \nagreements do not deal with a recognized Aboriginal right of self -government in \nmatters of public security or with treaties within the meaning of s . 35 of the \nConstitution Act, 1982 . Indeed, s.  35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 does not apply to \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n \n the present appeal. However, in my view, that does not necessarily preclude the \napplication of the principle of the honour of the Crown to how the contractual  \nundertakings agreed to by the parties must be fulfilled.  \n In Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2013 \nSCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para.  68, this Court stated that “[t]he honour of the \nCrown imposes a heavy obligation, and not a ll interactions between the Crown and \nAboriginal people engage it.” Accordingly, it is well established that purely \ncommercial dealings between Indigenous peoples and the Crown, for example, are \nunlikely to create particular obligations ( Mitchell v. Peguis  Indian Band , [1990] 2 \nS.C.R. 85, at p.  138). That said, the honour of the Crown is at minimum at stake in the \ngovernment’s “dealing” with Indigenous peoples ( R. v. Badger , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, \nat para.  41; Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor Gen eral in Council) , 2018 \nSCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, at para.  23). \n To date, this Court has concluded that the Crown is indeed in dealings with \nIndigenous peoples when it comes to Aboriginal rights, treaty rights, a fiduciary duty \nowed to them by the state o r an explicit obligation to an Indigenous group enshrined in \nthe Constitution by constitutional promises  (Manitoba Metis Federation , at \nparas.  68-73). \n None of these circumstances are present in this case. The agreements are \nnot comparable to a treaty, and they do not [ TRANSLATION ] “serve to recognize, define, \naffect, limit or create Aboriginal rights or treaty rights”, as expressly stated in the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n \n tripartite agreements (art.  1.4.1). The relationship between the parties by the terms of \nthe tripartite agreement s more closely resembles a relationship that is based on private \nlaw contracts that create legally enforceable obligations ( Canada (Attorney General) \nv. British Columbia Investment Management Corp. , 2019 SCC 63, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 559, \nat paras.  94-95). That being so, I agree with my colleague that the tripartite agreements, \nwhich provide for the financial support of Indigenous police services by the \ngovernments, are not purely commercial contracts. The principle of the honour of the \nCrown therefore cannot be ignored in the assessment of Quebec’s conduct in the course \nof these agreements.  \n In enacting s.  90 of the PA, Quebec legislated with the specific objective \nof offering Indigenous communities within its territory the possibility of providing \nservices distin ct from those provided to the population in general. I agree that this \nobjective is based on the reconciliation of pre -existing Indigenous societies with the \nassertion of Crown sovereignty, thus engaging the “special relationship” between \nIndigenous people s and the Crown ( Manitoba Metis Federation , at paras.  66-67, \nquoting Beckman v.

Desautel , 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para.  30). \n This same objective of recon ciliation is evident by operation of s.  72 of the \nPA, which provides that an Indigenous community may, if it so wishes , be served by \nits own police force, whatever the size of its population, and states that Indigenous \npolice forces are not required to pro vide service at the level offered to non -Indigenous \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n \n communities. In this context, the police force’s responsibilities are defined in the \ntripartite agreements as including that of [ TRANSLATION ] “ensuring a police presence \nthat makes it possible to respond,  within a reasonable time, to the requests for assistance \nmade to it” (art.  2.2.2). It was agreed by the parties that the Indigenous police force \nmay be provided services or assistance from the Sûreté du Québec to carry out its \nmission pursuant to s.  93 of  the PA (arts.  2.2.4 and 2.2.5).  \n The obligations incumbent on the Crown under the tripartite agreements \nare part of the contractual civil liability regime established by the Civil Code of Québec . \nArticle 1376 C.C.Q. makes the rules of Book Five applicable  to actions in liability \nagainst legal persons established in the public interest, including the state, “subject to \nany other rules of law which may be applicable to them” (see Prud’homme v. \nPrud’homme , 2002 SCC 85, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 663, at paras.  27-28). U nlike my \ncolleague, I am of the opinion, like Bich  J.A., that to the express stipulations of the \ntripartite agreements are added, pursuant to art.  1434 C.C.Q. , the public law obligations \nderived from them in conformity with law. The preliminary provision o f the C.C.Q.  \nlays down the jus commune in the province. The provisions of that statute must be \ninterpreted broadly so that their purpose can be achieved ( Doré v. Verdun (City) , [1997] \n2 S.C.R. 862); they must be given “the broadest possible” scope ( Prud’ho mme , at \npara.  29). In this context, such obligations take on a contractual [ TRANSLATION ] \n“colouring”, which gives rise to remedies that are contractual in nature in the event of \na breach (P. -A. Crépeau, “Le contenu obligationnel d’un contrat” (1965), 43 Can. Bar \nRev. 1, at pp.  21 and 28).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n \n \n The obligation to act honourably just like the obligation to act in good faith \ngovern the conduct of the government parties, both at the time the obligation arises and \nat the time it is performed or extinguished. However, it is important to note that this is \nan obligation of means, not of result. I agree with my colleague when he states that the \nhonour of the Crown is “not a cause of action” in itself, but “speaks to how obligations \nthat attract it must be fulfilled” (para.  149, quoting Manitoba Metis Federation , at \npara.  73 (emphasis in original); see also Mikisew , at para.  60). Articles 6, 7 and 1375 \nC.C.Q. and the principle of the honour of the Crown require the Crown to negotiate in \ngood faith even before an agreement is  entered into ( Delgamuukw v. British Columbia , \n[1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para.  186; Beckman , at para.  108).

Quebec Undertook To Contribute Financially to the Establishment and \nMaintenance of the Sécurité Publique de Mashteuiatsh  \n At the hear t of the dispute between Quebec and Takuhikan is their \nrespective understanding of the tripartite agreements and of the scope of the obligations \nflowing from them. Since the start of the proceedings, Takuhikan has argued that the \ngovernment parties are res ponsible for all of the costs incurred by its police force, \nindependently of the terms of the agreements. According to Takuhikan, Quebec \nimplicitly adhered to the Federal Policy and the FNPP, from which such an obligation \nflows.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n \n \n With respect, I am of the o pinion that the Court of Appeal erred in \nconcluding as it did in this regard. First, the government parties did not undertake, \nsolemnly or otherwise, to pay all of the costs related to the creation and maintenance \nof a police force that could ensure the sa me level of service as that found in \ncommunities in the region. Second, Quebec’s undertaking cannot be defined in light of \nthe objectives set out in the Federal Policy  and the FNPP. Those documents could not \nbind Quebec, nor do they support the interpretat ion adopted by the Court of Appeal. \nLastly, and contrary to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, the principle of the honour of \nthe Crown could not serve as a basis for rewriting the terms of the tripartite agreements \nto introduce such an obligation into them  and, in effect, contradict the plain terms of \nthe agreements.  \n(1) Quebec’s Undertaking Flows Strictly From the Tripartite Agreements  \n The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the scope of Quebec’s undertaking \ndisregards the clear language in which the tripartite agreements are written. It is clear \nfrom reading these agreements that Quebec undertook to contribute financially to the \nestabli shment and maintenance of the Sécurité publique de Mashteuiatsh, in the \namounts specified in the agreements, in compliance with the mandate conferred on \nother police forces by the PA and in accordance with the respective jurisdictions of \nCanada and Quebec.  \n It is important first to note that the parties expressed their intent to be bound \nsolely by the express terms of the tripartite agreements by stipulating an entire \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 152 ---\n \n agreement clause. It is the very first clause in the agreement, under the heading \n[TRANSLAT ION] “Content of the agreement”: “This agreement .  . . constitutes the \nentirety of the parties’ undertakings and responsibilities” (art.  1.1). Nothing forbids the \nparties from stipulating a clause of this sort in order to exclude any content external to \nthe contract, thus excluding the application of arts.  1425 and 1434 C.C.Q.  (Aéroports \nde Montréal v. Meilleur , [1997] R.J.Q. 1516 (C.A.), at p.  1529; Invenergy Wind \nCanada v. Éolectric inc. , 2019 QCCA 1073, at para.  10). \n Bouchard J.A. stated that [ TRANSLATIO N] “article 1426 C.C.Q.  inevitably \nleads to a consideration of the particular nature of the tripartite agreements and the \ncircumstances in which they were entered into” (C.A. reasons, at para.  62). No one is \nsuggesting that an entire agreement clause such as the one stipulated in the tripartite \nagreements can override rules of public order or even those constitutional in nature. In \nparticular, obligations that may flow from the principle of the honour of the Crown \ncould not be excluded by such a clause, as this principle applies independently of the \nexpressed will of the parties: “  . . . the Crown",

In \nparticular, obligations that may flow from the principle of the honour of the Crown \ncould not be excluded by such a clause, as this principle applies independently of the \nexpressed will of the parties: “  . . . the Crown cannot contract out of its duty of \nhonourable dealing with Aboriginal people” ( Beckman , at para.  61). That is not the case \nfor the general objectives set out in th e Federal Policy  or those stated by the Quebec \nlegislature when it enacted s.  90 of the PA. Those objectives are not rules of public \norder, nor are they even rules, strictly speaking.  \n That being said, I will now turn to the clauses of the agreement that de fine \nthe scope of Quebec’s undertaking. The preamble states that [ TRANSLATION ] “Canada \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n \n and Quebec .  . . wish to provide financial support  for the expenses incurred” by \nTakuhikan (emphasis added).  \n With respect, I disagree with the proposition that the objec tives of the \ntripartite agreements include those of establishing and maintaining an Indigenous \npolice force that provides services adapted to the community and of a quality \ncomparable to those provided in communities in the region. The obligation to mainta in \na police force that provides services of a quality comparable to those provided in \ncommunities in the region appears nowhere in the language of the agreements. The \nparties defined the agreement’s two objectives as being to [ TRANSLATION ] “establish \nand m aintain the ‘Mashteuiatsh Police Force’ .  . . that will be responsible for ensuring \nthe provision of police services in the community” and to “establish a contribution  from \nCanada and Quebec to the funding for the provision of the police services covered b y \nthis agreement” (art.  1.5 (emphasis added)). Moreover, the resolutions passed by \nTakuhikan to approve the 2013 -2014, 2014 -2015 and 2015 -2016 tripartite agreements \nreflect this understanding of art.  1.5 in that they recognize that Canada and Quebec \nwished  to provide financial support for the establishment and then the maintenance of \nthe police force.  \n Article 4.2.1 sets out the manner of determining the maximum amount of \nthe costs to be funded. Takuhikan [ TRANSLATION ] “shall respect the budget set out in \nSchedule A” (art.  4.2.3), and this budget describes all of the amounts that are used to \nachieve the purpose of the agreement (art.  4.7.1); any other source of government \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n \n funding allows Canada and Quebec to reduce their respective contribution or request a \ntotal or partial reimbursement of it (art.  4.7.2). As indicated by the evidence, the budget \nin the schedule to the agreement was prepared by Takuhikan on the basis of the \ncontributions provided by Canada and Quebec (A.R., vol.  XVI, at pp.  108-10). \n In additio n, it is clear from reading the agreements that the payment of the \ngovernment contributions is conditional on the existence of the necessary annual \nappropriation, given by Parliament or by the Assemblée nationale (art.  4.4.1). It is \nexpressly stipulated th at [TRANSLATION ] “[i]f there are no appropriations available to \nfund Indigenous police services or if those appropriations have been decreased, Canada \nor Quebec may reduce its funding or terminate [the] agreement” (art.  4.4.2).  \n The scope of Quebec’s undert aking is also circumscribed and limited in \nlight of the clause that establishes Takuhikan’s responsibility for any budget deficits \nthat could be incurred, as well as the clause specifying that the governments are not \nresponsible for undertakings given by T akuhikan in relation to the tripartite agreement, \nthat is, arts.  4.5.2 and 5.4.1, which it is important to reproduce in full:  \n[TRANSLATION ] \n4.5.2  The Council shall be responsible for any budget deficits  incurred \nduring a fiscal year and [the deficits] may not be carried forward to \nthe next fiscal year.  \n . . .",

Quebe c’s reply was \nthat it complied with its undertaking to provide financial support to Mashteuiatsh’s \npolice force as agreed pursuant to the agreements (A.F., at paras.  97-98). That said, it \nhas not been demonstrated that the clauses are abusive within the me aning of art.  1437 \nC.C.Q.  (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para.  71). \n(2) The Federal Policy  Cannot Define Quebec’s Undertaking  \n I agree with the Attorney General of Quebec that the Court of Appeal could \nnot impose on Quebec obligations flowing from the Federal Policy for three reasons.  \n First, Quebec did not undertake to implement the Federal Policy . No such \nundertaking is found in the PA or in the agreements at issue. The only reference to this \npolicy can be found in a recital of the preamble to the agreements which state s that: \n[TRANSLATION ] “Canada  will provide its share of the financial contribution under this \nagreement in accordance with the [FNPP] and in compliance with the policies and \nterms and conditions related thereto” (emphasis added). The fact that Quebec is no t \nmentioned in this recital of the preamble reflects the parties’ intent that only Canada \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n \n commit itself under the FNPP and the Federal Policy . Such intent reflects the fact that, \nwhen Quebec enters into agreements with Indigenous communities, it does so pu rsuant \nto its own powers and in accordance with the terms of its legislative framework, that \nis, the PA. \n Second, the Court of Appeal was mistaken to consider the Federal Policy \nin defining Quebec’s undertaking because, by its very nature, such a policy doe s not \nestablish binding rules and is therefore not subject to judicial sanction. In R. v. Beaudry , \n2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at paras.  45-46, this Court concluded that a policy \nthat did not spring from a statutory provision cannot have the force of law. Even on the \nassumption that the Federal Policy may have interpretive value, the terms of the \nagreements reached are clear with respect to funding and require no interpretation.  \n Third, and I say this respectfully, the Court of Appeal distorted the cont ent \nof the Federal Policy . As the Attorney General of Quebec points out, nowhere in the \npolicy is it stated that the governments will fund all of the costs of the police services; \nit merely provides for financial “contributions” allocated to those services . Indeed, only \nthe conclusion of agreements can create entitlement to such contributions. Further, the \nFederal Policy  expressly provides for the financial participation of communities to \ncover certain police force expenses, in addition to containing variou s statements \nregarding the availability of funds. Section V, which is devoted to funding, specifies, \nin particular, that signatory communities will, where possible, be encouraged to “help \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 157 ---\n \n pay for the cost of maintaining their police service, particularly f or enhanced services” \n(p. 6). \n(3) The Honour of the Crown Cannot Serve as a Basis for Rewriting the \nTripartite Agreements From the Standpoint of Either the Public Law \nPrinciple or the Implied",

As I have stated, I fully agree with him on this \npoint. However, a careful reading of his reasons reveals that the purpo se of Quebec’s \nundertaking has been considerably and implicitly expanded to ultimately include an \nobligation for Quebec to provide services adapted to the community comparable to \nthose of communities in the region (paras.  14, 34, 183 -84 and 216). As this o bjective \nof providing services comparable to those provided to communities in the region is \nnowhere to be found in the agreements, this expanded purpose is inconsistent with the \nconclusion that the Federal Policy is not binding on Quebec,  as well as with t he \nassertion that the honour of the Crown cannot constitute a cause of action . I emphasize \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 158 ---\n \n this because such an expansion of the scope of Quebec’s undertaking to Takuhikan is \ntantamount to rewriting the terms of these agreements, which is something that th e \nprinciple of the honour of the Crown cannot be used to do.  \n On this point, I agree with the appellant, the Attorney General of Quebec, \nand the intervening attorneys general that the honour of the Crown cannot serve as a \nbasis for rewriting the terms of th e agreements. If the Court must draw on the \njurisprudence relating to the honour of the Crown to conclude that this principle can be \napplied to tripartite agreements such as those at issue in this case, then the Court should \nalso draw inspiration from that  jurisprudence in interpreting those instruments.  \n The principles relating to the interpretation of modern treaties and treaty \nland entitlement agreements are particularly relevant and undisputed. It is well \nestablished that courts must “pay close attention ” to the terms of treaties, defer to them \nand “strive to respect [the] handiwork” of the parties, bearing in mind that “[a]lthough \nnot exhaustively so, reconciliation is found in the respectful fulfillment of a modern \ntreaty’s terms” ( First Nation of Nacho  Nyak Dun v. Yukon , 2017 SCC 58, [2017] 2 \nS.C.R. 576, at paras.  36-38, quoting Moses , at para.  7, and Beckman , at para.  54). \n I can put it no better than the Federal Court of Appeal did in Saskatchewan \n(Attorney General) v. Witchekan Lake First Nation , 2023  FCA 105, 482 D.L.R. (4th) \n352. In that case, the court summarily dismissed an action brought by a First Nation \nagainst Saskatchewan and Canada for having breached what it argued to be implied \nobligations flowing from a treaty land entitlement agreement. R ennie  J.A., writing for \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 159 ---\n \n a unanimous court, concluded that the action did not establish a serious issue, as the \nimplied terms raised pursuant to the principle of the honour of the Crown were \ninconsistent with the plain language of the agreement:  \n  This inte rpretive frame or lens, however, does not entitle a court to \nreopen and rewrite  the settled terms of a modern agreement negotiated \nbetween sophisticated parties over many years and with independent legal \nadvice.

Failing to respect the finality and legal ce rtainty  of the Framework \nAgreement undermines reconciliation  by allowing parties to renegotiate \nand to seek more favourable terms than those originally settled on. \nAllowing the parties “[t]o seek ambiguities [in the agreement] at all costs” \nin the hopes of  reinterpreting its provisions can only diminish the value of \nthe settlement, and “other signing parties [must] not feel themselves at the \nmercy of constant attempts to renegotiate in the courts” ( Eastmain Band v. \nCanada (Federal Administrator) , [1993] 1 F .C. 501, [(C.A.)] at 518 -519). \nA paradigm under which each generation can reopen, renegotiate, and \nrewrite previously settled matters is untenable (see also Goodswimmer  [v. \nCanada (Attorney General) , 2017 ABCA 365, 418 D.L.R. (4th) 157],  at \npara.  49; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc v. Brian Pallister  et al. , 2021 \nMBCA 47, 458 D.L.R.

The point was made in [ Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. \nPasqua First Nation , 2018 FCA 141] at paragraph 13:  \n  Counsel for the respondents repeated several times that the Crown \ncannot contract out of constitutional and treaty rights. This is not \ndisputed. However , in my view it follows that one cannot later “contract \nin” constitutional and treaty rights arguments i nto every term of a \nmodern agreement between the parties even where the parties agreed on \nspecific terms to address outstanding issues, in a way that fundamentally \nchanges the terms of the agreement retrospectively. Rather, the honour \nof the Crown requires  that the Crown adhere to and implement the terms \nof the agreement in an open and fair manner ( [Wewaykum Indian Band \nv. Canada , 2003 SCC 45, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259] ). [Emphasis added; \nparas.  128-29.] \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 160 ---\n \n \n I would add that such an approach is also contrary to the i mplied \nobligations regime in Quebec civil law. With respect, I am of the opinion that the Court \nof Appeal erred in relying on art.  1434 C.C.Q.  to add to the agreement obligations \ninspired by the Federal Policy , obligations  that it characterized as “implied ”, and which \nare inconsistent with the explicit funding clauses of the agreements, including the \nclause relating to the responsibility for deficits. Article 1434 C.C.Q. does not authorize \nsuch an outcome, nor can it be used to frustrate other provisions of  the agreement. An \nimplied obligation can only fill a gap in the terms of the contract (D.  Lluelles and \nB. Moore, Droit des obligations  (3rd ed. 2018), at No.  1542; J. -L. Baudouin and \nP.-G. Jobin, Les obligations  (7th ed. 2013), by P. -G. Jobin and N.  Vézin a, at No.  431; \nChurchill Falls , at para.  74), not outright modify an explicit obligation of the contract.  \n At the very beginning of these reasons, I referred to the Latin locution pacta \nsunt servanda  (“agreements must be kept”). This locution, which reflect s the binding \nforce of the contract, is part of both contract law and public law. It means that the \nparties are bound by the contract that they have entered into and that, accordingly, they \ncannot derogate from the obligations resulting therefrom.  \n I theref ore conclude that Quebec did not breach its obligation to act \nhonourably in performing an obligation that was not incumbent upon it under the terms \nof the contracts",

With respect, the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal is \nerroneous in that it imposes on the government parties, through the principle of the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 161 ---\n \n honour of the Crown and art.  1434 C.C.Q. , an obligation of result that has no basis in \nthe terms of the tripartite agreements.  \nC. Quebec Did Not Act Dishonourably or Abusively  \n The absence of an assessme nt by the Court of Appeal on the scope of \nQuebec’s undertaking had the effect of skewing its analysis as regards the abusive \nand/or dishonourable nature of its conduct, like through a distorting lens. It is in light \nof the undertakings upon which the parti es actually agreed that Quebec’s conduct \ntoward Takuhikan must be assessed. The analysis should therefore be done again.  \n I disagree with the proposition that Quebec acted abusively and \ndishonourably in the implementation of art.  6.10.2, which concerns the renewal of the \nagreement. Neither good faith nor the honour of the Crown serves as a basis for \nexpanding the scope of the contractual undertakings agreed to by the parties.  \n With respect to good faith, Quebec fulfilled all of its undertakings and did \nnot ab use any right provided for in the contract, including regarding the renewal of the \ntripartite agreements. I am of the view that Houle v. Canadian National Bank , [1990] \n3 S.C.R. 122,  does not support the conclusion that it was unreasonable in this case for \nQuebec to insist on respecting the words of the agreements. It should first be noted that \nthe circumstances of Houle  were very different from those in this case. In Houle , \nL’Heureux -Dubé  J., writing for the Court, found that the bank had committed an abuse  \nof right in requiring the payment of a loan within a very short timeframe when it was \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 162 ---\n \n well aware that the shareholders, the Houle brothers, were in the middle of negotiating \nthe sale of their family business. In that context, any precipitous action, such as \nrecalling the loan, would have resulted in a reduction in the value of their shares. \nL’Heureux -Dubé  J. emphasized that the parties had been in a long -term contractual \nrelationship and that the bank had never informed the Houle brothers of any concerns \nregarding the repayment of the loan. In those circumstances, while the recall of the loan \ndid not constitute in itself an abuse of the bank’s contractual rights, the quick \nliquidation of the company’s assets did amount to an abuse of right. This Court drew \non L’Heureux -Dubé  J.’s comments when it stated in Churchill Falls , at para.  118, that \ngood faith does not prevent a party from relying on the words of the contract unless \nthat insistence is unreasonable in the circumstances.  \n In the case at bar, we will se e that it was not unreasonable for Quebec to \nrely on the words of the agreements concerning the responsibility for the accumulated \ndeficits.  \n Furthermore, applying the principle of the honour of the Crown to how the \ncontractual undertakings given by Quebec must be fulfilled insofar as this principle is \nimplicitly incorporated into them, I find that Quebec acted honourably.  \n Let me explain.  \n While it is true that Quebec had to negotiate in good faith when renewing \nthe agreements, it was not required to enter in to a renewed contract commensurate with \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 163 ---\n \n Takuhikan’s expectations and to agree to all of its requests. The obligation to negotiate \nin good faith did not compel the parties to enter into an agreement or to agree on a \nmaximum contribution amount covering all of the costs of Mashteuiatsh’s police force. \nWhile it is clear that Takuhikan was disappointed with the outcome of the negotiations \nfollowing the renewal of the agreements, this does not mean that Quebec acted in bad \nfaith or that its conduct resulted from  an abuse of right ( Singh v.

The obligation to negotiate \nin good faith did not compel the parties to enter into an agreement or to agree on a \nmaximum contribution amount covering all of the costs of Mashteuiatsh’s police force. \nWhile it is clear that Takuhikan was disappointed with the outcome of the negotiations \nfollowing the renewal of the agreements, this does not mean that Quebec acted in bad \nfaith or that its conduct resulted from  an abuse of right ( Singh v. Kohli , 2015 QCCA \n1135, at para.  75). \n As LeBel and Deschamps  JJ. stated, dissenting in the result in Moses , at \npara.  116, the Crown must try “to reconcile Aboriginal rights and interests with those \nof the public more generally, because the Crown must be mindful of Aboriginal \ninterests but must also consider the public interest. Modern agreements thus reflect a \nmixture of rights, obligations, payments and concessions that have already been \ncarefully balanced.”  \n Accordingly, even though the government parties were aware of their \ncounterparty’s grievances and the deficits accumulated by it, they proceeded to renew \nthe agreements with the resources available and further to the appropriations given by \nParliament and the Assemblée nati onale, as contemplated in the agreements in force. \nCriticizing Quebec for not exercising the right to terminate the agreement constitutes, \nin my opinion, a moot point, as it was clear from reading the agreements that Quebec \ncould either terminate them or r educe the funding (art.  4.4.2).  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 164 ---\n \n \n Although my colleague also acknowledges that Takuhikan was not entitled \nto a particular result at the end of the negotiations by virtue of the obligation to negotiate \nin good faith, respectfully, his conclusion suggests the opposite. In fact, confirming the \nquantum of damages claimed by Takuhikan amounts to granting it all of the funding \nrequests that it made during the renewals. However, Takuhikan had accepted that \nQuebec’s financial contributions did not fully meet its need s and that it would be \nrequired to assume any deficits. Concluding in this way amounts to rewriting the terms \nof the agreement entered into by the parties and to making the principle of the honour \nof the Crown a cause of action.  \n At the risk of repeating m yself, Quebec was not required to fund the police \nforce in a manner that would allow for the provision of services of the same quality as \nthose provided to non -Indigenous communities or to pay all of the costs of the police \nforce.  \n It is true that Takuhikan  made the decision to abolish its police force as of \nApril  1, 2016, because of a lack of funding, a decision that was announced to Canada \nand Quebec in November 2015, but that was ultimately not carried out. However, a \nreview of the circumstances surroundi ng that decision does not support a finding of \nabuse of right or dishonourable conduct on the part of Quebec during the renewal of \nthe agreements. On the contrary, the evidence instead shows that, throughout their \ncontractual relationship, including the pe riod during which Takuhikan intended to \nabolish its police force, Quebec listened attentively to its counterparty’s grievances and \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 165 ---\n \n was flexible in seeking solutions to the problem of the underfunding of its police force. \nIn that regard, Quebec proposed and  implemented a variety of additional measures \nproviding Mashteuiatsh’s police force with financial support, which attest to the fact \nthat Quebec’s conduct was in compliance with the standards imposed by good faith and \nthe principle of the honour of the Cro wn. It is essential to review these measures.  \n(1) Quebec’s Additional Measures To Support Mashteuiatsh’s Police Force  \n I begin by noting that from 2006, Quebec contributed, up to a maximum \namount of $743,208, to funding the construction of the community’s polic e station \n(capital funding agreement under the Aboriginal Development Fund, reproduced in \nA.R., vol.  XIV, at pp.  19-25; loan repayment agreement of March  24, 2006, reproduced \nin A.R., vol.  XIV, at pp.  126-29). \n In 2013, Quebec was well aware that Mashteuiat sh’s police force was \nexperiencing financial difficulties. Thus, in the 2013 -2014 fiscal year, Takuhikan was \ngiven $284,514 in additional financial support to be allocated to training and the \npurchase of equipment, including $136,567 from Quebec.",

Thus, in the 2013 -2014 fiscal year, Takuhikan was \ngiven $284,514 in additional financial support to be allocated to training and the \npurchase of equipment, including $136,567 from Quebec. It is imp ortant to bear in \nmind that this additional financial support was not taken from the funding envelope \ndedicated to the tripartite agreements, which was strictly limited by Parliament and the \nAssemblée nationale, but rather from other government programs. T he testimony of \nQuebec’s representative, Richard Coleman, shows that Quebec listened to the \ndifficulties expressed by Takuhikan and was flexible and creative in finding alternative \nsolutions (A.R., vol.  XVII, at pp.  65-66). \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 166 ---\n \n \n In 2014, Quebec made efforts to help Takuhikan with the financial \ndifficulties arising from the arbitration award rendered in July 2014 concerning a \nretroactive pay increase for the police officers of the Mashteuiatsh police force. \nAlthough the increase in government contributions propos ed during the renewal of the \ntripartite agreement did not meet the needs expressed by Takuhikan (only 1.5 percent), \nQuebec and Takuhikan entered into subsequent agreements to reduce operational and \nmanagement costs. In fact, Quebec loaned personnel from th e Sûreté du Québec for \ntwo years to offset the elimination of a management position between 2013 and 2015, \nand gave Mashteuiatsh police officers access to the indoor firing range at the Sûreté du \nQuébec headquarters in Chicoutimi (testimony of Richard Cole man, A.R., vol.  XVII, \nat p. 63; testimony of Dannye Bonneau, A.R., vol.  XV, at pp.  7 and 20 -21).  \n After Takuhikan announced the shutdown of its police force in November \n2015, Quebec (Quebec alone, without Canada) and Takuhikan entered into a \ntransitional a greement in March 2016 for the maintenance and provision of police \nservices. That agreement provided for a fixed additional contribution of $400,000 that \ncould be used [ TRANSLATION ] “to cover any deficit related to the provision of police \nservices in the community of Mashteuiatsh” (art.  4.1, reproduced in A.R., vol.  XI, at \np. 25). That agreement therefore gave Takuhikan considerable flexibility to lessen the \nimpact of the deficits in curred in previous years.  \n At trial, Takuhikan essentially argued that the amount in that transitional \nagreement could not be deducted from the amount claimed because that contribution \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 167 ---\n \n could have been used to absorb the deficits accumulated for periods that  are now \nprescribed (testimony of Valérie Tremblay, A.R., vol.  XVI, at p.  148). Yet, art.  3.3 of \nthe transitional agreement states the following: [ TRANSLATION ] “The parties agree that, \nat the conclusion of any complaint process or any other proceeding rela ting to the \nfunding of the police force, the amounts paid under this agreement will be deducted \nfrom any amount that Quebec could be ordered to pay to the Council.” Moreover, I \nnote that art.  6.1 specifies the following: [ TRANSLATION ] “The parties agree th at the \nfixed additional contribution mentioned in article 2.1 of this agreement does not \nconstitute recognition by Quebec of a recurring need for additional funding.”  \n Finally, in 2017, an agreement providing for the payment of $375,000 at \nthe rate of $125, 000 per year, spanning the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, was entered \ninto by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique and Takuhikan in connection with the \nPrévention Jeunesse funding program. One of that program’s objectives is to support \npartner organizations, including Indigenous police forces, in order to prevent crime \namong Indigenous youth (A.R., vol.  XIV, at p.  1).   \n In light of the foregoing, I cannot bring myself to describe these various \nmeasures as “supplemental assistance” as does my colleague, or even  as a “Band -Aid”, \n",

The additional financial \nassistance provided by Quebec to Takuhikan as part of their contractual relationship to \nmaintain Mashteuiatsh’s police force must be taken into account in the assessme nt of \nQuebec’s conduct with respect to the renewal of the tripartite agreements and with \nrespect to the injury that may have resulted from it.  \n(2) Deference towards Takuhikan’s Contractual and Financial Autonomy  \n I also cannot bring myself to conclude that Queb ec’s conduct during the \nrenewal of the agreements was contrary to good faith because it apparently “exploited \n[the] position of weakness” (Kasirer  J.’s reasons, at para.  137) of its counterparty or \nthat this conduct was dishonourable because of “the precar ious situation in which \n[Takuhikan] found itself” (para.  196; see also para.  10). With respect, such an approach \ncompletely ignores the capacity to act, the agency and the contractual and financial \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n \n autonomy of Takuhikan, which, moreover, has not alleged an y defect of consent with \nrespect to the renewal of the agreements.  \n Takuhikan’s contractual autonomy is particularly reflected in the free and \ninformed choice it made to offer a level of service above the one provided for in the \ntripartite agreements, rath er than terminate the agreements (Sup. Ct. reasons, at \nparas.  63-69, in particular paras.  66-68). The trial judge, who had the opportunity to \nexamine the evidence in depth and to hear testimony, concluded that Takuhikan \nrenewed the agreements [ TRANSLATION ] “knowingly because of the fact that the level \nof funding [from the governments] is not commensurate with the quality of the service \nthat [Takuhikan] wishes to provide to the member[s] of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh First \nNation” (para.  67). As the trial judge n oted, this is clear from a letter dated December  8, \n2008 (P -8), which states that the funding provided by Quebec at that time represented \nan [ TRANSLATION ] “acceptable compromise considering [Quebec’s] financial \nlimitations and [Takuhikan’s] concern for mai ntaining and developing a quality police \nforce” (para.  67; A.R., vol.  II, at p.  32). This finding of fact is entitled to deference.  \n The precarious situation described by my colleague totally disregards the \nfinancial autonomy Takuhikan had during the renewa l of the agreements. In this regard, \nit is helpful to reproduce the remarks of Binnie  J., who wrote on behalf of the majority \nin Moses , that agreements negotiated between government and Indigenous parties must \nbe considered on the basis of the terms that t he parties actually agreed to, particularly \nbecause they have the resources necessary to act the way they do:  \n2024",

Badger , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, Cory  J. pointed out that Aboriginal \n“[t]reaties are analogous to contracts, albeit of a very solemn and sp ecial, \npublic nature” (para.  76). At issue in that case was an 1899 treaty. The \ncontract analogy is even more apt in relation to a modern comprehensive \ntreaty whose terms (unlike in 1899) are not constituted by an exchange of \nverbal promises reduced to wri ting in a language many of the Aboriginal \nsignatories did not understand (paras.  52-53). The text of modern \ncomprehensive treaties is meticulously negotiated by well -resourced \nparties. As my colleagues note, “all parties to the Agreement were \nrepresented b y counsel, and the result of the negotiations was set out in \ndetail in a 450 -page legal document” (para.  118). The importance and \ncomplexity of the actual text is one of the features that distinguishes the \nhistoric treaties made with Aboriginal people from  the modern \ncomprehensive agreement or treaty, of which the James Bay Treaty was \nthe pioneer. We should therefore pay close attention to its terms. [para. 7]  \n In the present case, Takuhikan’s financial statements show accumulated \nbudget surpluses totalling several million dollars. The trial judge concluded from the \nevidence that the council had own -source revenues that were much greater than its \npolice force’s deficit (para.  83). With all due respect to the Court of Appeal, no palpable \nand overriding error w as demonstrated to warrant its intervention with respect to this \nfinding of fact.  \n In addition, in its annual report for the 2014 -2015 fiscal year, Takuhikan \nstated the following: [TRANSLATION ] “ . . . Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan reiterates the \nimportance o f remaining vigilant in this situation of an underfunding of programs and \nservices and notes that the community has a solid own -source revenue base  and [has] \nflexibility [under] certain funding agreements  to achieve its financial objectives” (A.R., \nvol. XIII, at p.  19 (emphasis added)). Although the own -source revenues do not \nnecessarily reflect the flexibility Takuhikan actually had, it is important to mention \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 171 ---\n \n that, as of March  20, 2013, they totalled $12,452,727 (testimony of Valérie Tremblay, \nA.R., vol.  XVI, at p.  92-93; A.R., vol.  XIII, at p.  207). With respect, the contractual \nimbalance resulting from Quebec’s conduct described by my colleague provides no \nbasis for concluding that Quebec breached its obligations to act in good faith and \nhonourably.  \n As I  stated at the outset, given the responsibility incumbent upon \nTakuhikan to assume the deficits pursuant to the agreements and its approval regarding \nthe scope of the funding provided by Quebec, it appears that, before this Court, \nTakuhikan is challenging Quebec’s public policy decisions concerning the giving of \nfinancial support to Indigenous police forces. However, the role of the courts is not to \ninterfere in this way in the budget decisions of government parties, which are reflected \nin the tripartite ag reements at issue. Concluding otherwise has the effect of sanctioning \na discretionary policy decision concerning the allocation of budgetary resources of the \nstate, which is something the Court cannot do without brushing aside the separation of \npowers doct rine in doing so ( Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario , at \nparas.  27-31). \nD.

I will \nnonethe less say a few words on the approach suggested by colleague, about which, and \nI say so with all due respect, I have some serious reservations.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 172 ---\n \n \n I am not convinced that it is necessary to create a remedial scheme based \non “reconciliatory justice”. I fail to see why the rules of corrective justice could not be \nadapted to consider the Indigenous perspective and the imperative of reconciliation \nwhen a court finds that the Crown has not acted in good faith and with honour in the \ncontext of a contractual relations hip with an Indigenous party.  \n In my opinion, the civil liability regime already makes it possible to respect \nthe objective of reconciliation through the principle of full compensation (that is, \nrestitutio in integrum ). Accordingly, I do not agree with the idea that reconciliatory \njustice “transcends the corrective justice at the heart of private law to make room for \nrepairing and maintaining the special relationship with the Indigenous peoples on \nwhom European laws and customs were imposed” (para.  148, citi ng Manitoba Metis \nFederation , at para.  67, and Haida Nation  v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , \n2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at para.  17). \n Damages awarded for breach of the obligation of good faith (and, \nincidentally, for breach of the principle of the honour of the Crown) are generally \ncompensatory in nature, in order [ TRANSLATION ] “to restore an economic balance upset \nby the contracting party’s breach” (Lluelles and Moore, at No.  2018). Injury can be \ncompensated for if it is the logica l, direct and immediate consequence of the alleged \nfault (art.  1607 C.C.Q .). Furthermore, in contractual matters, art.  1613 C.C.Q.  provides \nthat the debtor is liable only for damages that were foreseen or foreseeable at the time \nthe obligation was contract ed. If the fault committed is gross or intentional, the creditor \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 173 ---\n \n will be entitled to all damages, including those that were not foreseeable at the time of \nthe meeting of the parties’ minds.  \n This exercise may pose some additional difficulties when it comes to \nremedying a breach of the principle of the honour of the Crown. Indeed, if the court \nchooses to resort to damages as appropriate compensation, identifying and precisely \nquantifying injury, such as the loss of a police force culturally adapted to the nee ds of \nthe community, can sometimes be complex. That being so, these difficulties are nothing \nnew for the courts, which have long been required to use their discretion in determining \nan indemnity that is fair and reasonable having regard to all the circumst ances \n(Vidéotron, s.e.n.c. v. Bell ExpressVu, l.p. , 2015 QCCA 422, at paras.  86-87). Indeed, \non an assessment of the injury involving largely unforeseeable or unquantifiable \nfactors, courts must, in making this calculation, [ TRANSLATION ] “rely on a certain  \namount of approximation and estimation, as well as [their] own discretion” (Provigo \nDistribution Inc. v. Supermarché A.R.G. Inc. , 1997 CanLII 10209 (Que. C.A.), at \np. 65). In fact, [ TRANSLATION ] “[u]ncertainty regarding the damage in itself must be \ndistin guished from uncertainty caused by the difficulty of precisely measuring the \ndamage because of the nature of the legal dispute, the realities of the proceedings, or \nthe complexity of the facts” ( p. 43). In other words, gaps in the evidence generally do \nnot relieve the court from ruling on the quantum of damages.  \n The principle of the honour of the Crown is anchored in the objective of \nreconciliation between prior occupation of the land by Indigenous peoples and the \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 174 ---\n \n Crown’s assertion of sovereignty.

It theref ore seems entirely logical and coherent that \nwhen faced with a largely unforeseeable and unquantifiable injury resulting from \ndishonourable conduct by the Crown, the court may use its discretion to establish a \nquantum that will take into account restoring the honour of the Crown and achieving \nthe objective of reconciliation. As regards corrective justice, nothing also prevents the \ncourt, in the exercise of its discretion, from giving consideration to the Indigenous \nperspective proposed by Robert Mainville, now a justice at the Court of Appeal of \nQuebec, in his work An Overview of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights and Compensation \nfor Their Breach  (2001),  at p. 127, without it being necessary to create a new remedial \nscheme under the name “reconciliatory justice”.  Even though such is not the case at the \ndetermination of liability stage, I am of the opinion that the courts can be somewhat \ncreative in exercising their discretion in order to quantify damages ( Ontario (Attorney \nGeneral) v.  Restoule , 2024 SCC 27, at par a. 277). This creativity must nonetheless be \nexercised within the principled legal framework, namely, that of corrective justice \nunder Quebec civil law.  \n This more circumscribed approach also avoids the trap posed by the highly \ndiscretionary nature of the r emedy anchored in reconciliatory justice in the case of a \nbreach of the honour of the Crown demonstrated in a contractual context. It is important \nto bear in mind that agreements like those at issue help ensure predictability, stability \nand transparency in  relationships between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. \nAccepting a remedial scheme that would allow courts to ignore provisions of \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n \n agreements duly negotiated between the parties could discourage governments from \nsigning these kinds of agreements with Ind igenous entities.  \n It seems clear to me that the principles of corrective justice, when applied \nto the present case, cannot justify compensating Takuhikan for all of the deficits \naccumulated by its police force. Deduction should be made from the damages awa rded \nto Takuhikan for the amounts paid by Quebec in 2014 and in 2016, the amount of the \nacquittance given under the transitional agreement, as well as any prescribed amount. \nIf I had concluded that Quebec’s conduct was dishonourable or contrary to good fai th, \nI would have remitted the matter to the trial judge for consideration of the extent of the \ninjury and of the causal connection. The government parties undertook to contribute \nfinancially to the maintenance of Mashteuiatsh’s police force, not to all of its \noperational costs. In this regard, I agree with Quebec that the Court of Appeal could \nnot fix the damages at an amount exactly equal to that of the deficits accumulated by \nTakuhikan, because, in any event, Takuhikan gave a contractual undertaking to as sume \nthose deficits and because the governments did not undertake to fund all of the costs \ngenerated by the police force.  \nIV. Conclusion  \n For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment, \nwith costs.  \n Appeal dismissed with costs, CÔTÉ J. dissenting.  \n2024 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 176 ---\n \n  Solicitors for the appellant : Lavoie, Rousseau  (Justice -Québec) , Québec ; \nMinistère de la Justice du Québec, Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, \nQuébec ; Bernard, Roy (Justice -Québec), Montréal . \n Solicitor s for the respondent : Cain Lamarre, Roberval.  \n Solicitor  for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada : Department \nof Justice Canada , Montréal.  \n Solicitor  for the intervener  the Attorney General of Ontario : Ministry of \nthe Attorney General,  Crown Law Office — Civil , Toronto . \n Solicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of \nSaskatchewan : Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Constitutional \nLaw Branch , Regina.  \n Solicitor for the intervener  the Attorney General of Alberta : Alberta \nJustice,  Constitutional a nd Aboriginal Law , Edmonton.  \n Solicitors for the intervener  the Assembly of First Nations Quebec -\nLabrador : Dionne Schulze, Montréal.  \n",
