To comply with the statutory \nand by -law provisions in force, Larochelle was required to transfer 10 % of the total \narea of its projects to the City for the purposes of parks, playgrounds or green spaces, \nbut it transferred excess l and. Since the City was unable to return the land or reimburse \nits value, and since the City wanted to acquire an additional area of land owned by \nLarochelle, the parties entered into an agreement creating a land area bank in favour of \nLarochelle. That ban k was to be applied in compensation for future park fees to be paid \nto the City in connection with cadastral operations allowing for new real estate \ndevelopments. In the end, however, those operations never took place.  \n Larochelle’s successor, Laroda, tur ned to the courts to seek compensation \nfor the value of the area bank. The Superior Court dismissed the application. It found \nthat the City’s obligation resulting from the agreement was conditional on the approval \nof cadastral operations , that is, a future  and uncertain event which had not occurred and \nfor which the parties had not stipulated any term. Because the fulfilment of the \ncondition had become impossible, the judge held that the City was released from its \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n \n obligations .

Because the fulfilment of the \ncondition had become impossible, the judge held that the City was released from its \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n \n obligations . The Court of Appeal allowed La roda’s appeal and ordered the City to pay \nLaroda $287,458.51. In its view, the parties’ goal had not been to extinguish the City’s \nobligation, but rather to delay when the performance of the obligation would be \nexigible. The parties had therefore made the City’s obligation subject to a term rather \nthan a condition, a term that had to be fixed by the court . Next, in determining the \nquantum of the remedy, the Court of Appeal held that the value of the excess received \nby the City had to be determined as of the  time when Larochelle had transferred the \nland, that is, in 2001.  \n Held : The City’s appeal should be dismissed and Laroda’s  cross -appeal \nshould be allowed in part. The City should be ordered to pay Laroda the market value \nof the land as of December  15, 201 5, and the case should be remanded to the Superior \nCourt for a determination of this value . \n The agreement extinguished the City’s prior debt relating to the excess land \ntransferred to it and, by formalizing the establishment of an area bank, transformed t hat \ninitial obligation into a new contractual obligation, thereby creating a distinct \nobligational relationship based on the terms of the agreement. This alteration of the \nobligation satisfies the legal criteria for novation . Moreover , the parties agreed o n an \nobligation with a suspensive term, since  the City’s obligation to effect compensation \nfor the value of the area bank would not become exigible until the occurrence of events \nthat the parties considered certain, namely cadastral operations allowing for  new real \nestate developments . The term was indeterminate, because the parties did not know \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n when those cadastral operations would take place. Having regard to the nature of the \nCity’s obligation, the situation of the parties and the circumstances, the term  must be \nfixed judicially at December  15, 2015, when Laroda sent the City a demand letter. \nUnder the performance by equivalence regime, Laroda is entitled to damages \nequivalent to the market value of the area recognized in the bank on that date . \n Novation is an alteration of an obligation that has two distinct and \nsimultaneous legal consequences: the extinction of the initial relationship, without \npayment, and the creation of a relationship that is both new and different . The principles \nrelating to novation  are set out in arts.  1660 to 1666 of the Civil Code of Québec . Three \ntypes of novation are provided for in those articles: (1)  by a change in debt; (2)  by a \nchange in debtor; and (3)  by a change in creditor.  Novation by a change in debt occurs \nwhen the de btor contracts, towards its creditor, a new debt that is substituted for the \nformer one, which is then extinguished . For there to be novation, five conditions must \nbe met: (1)  a prior obligation; (2)  a new obligation; (3)  the two obligations being \ndifferen t from each other; (4)  an intention to novate; and (5)  capacity to enter into a \ncontract.  The parties must have had the clear and evident intention to extinguish the \nexisting debt and to create a new one that is different from the first (art.  1661 C.C.Q. ). \nThus, novation cannot result from a combination of circumstances or an unintentional \nact by the parties.  The intention to novate does not need to be confirmed in writing and \nmay be tacit and result from the parties’ conduct . A high threshold of proof is r equired \nbecause of the fact that the extinction of the former debt entails a renunciation by the \ncreditor of the benefit of its rights.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n  In this case, novation was effected. The parties’ intention in entering into \nthe agreement was to extinguish the City’ s debt to Larochelle resulting from the excess \nreceived and to transform it into a new debt that was fundamentally different . The City \nand Larochelle agreed to enter into a contract that would establish a mechanism to \neffect compensation for the excess",

    "text": " the benefit of its rights.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n  In this case, novation was effected. The parties’ intention in entering into \nthe agreement was to extinguish the City’ s debt to Larochelle resulting from the excess \nreceived and to transform it into a new debt that was fundamentally different . The City \nand Larochelle agreed to enter into a contract that would establish a mechanism to \neffect compensation for the excess lan d transferred by Larochelle as well as formalize \nthe transfer and financing of the additional area the City wanted in order to complete \nits amenities. This mechanism took the form of a land area bank , which was  a form of \ncredit requiring the City to effect  compensation for future debts for parks, playgrounds \nor green spaces using the negotiated and agreed area making up the bank. It was only \nby carrying out future cadastral operations that the parties could use that bank, and their \nintended use of it consti tutes a truly new element . This is therefore novation by a change \nin debt, which produces the same effects as an acquittance for the prior debt resulting \nfrom the excess received . \n The modalities of an obligation concern the time limit for performance, the  \nnumber of parties involved or the number of prestations to be performed. An obligation \nwith a simple modality can be either conditional or with a term . An obligation is \nconditional where its creation or its extinction depends on a future and uncertain eve nt \n(art. 1497 C.C.Q. ). An obligation with a suspensive term is an obligation that arises \nimmediately but whose exigibility is suspended for a length of time defined by \nreference to a date on the calendar, a precisely identified period or the occurrence of a \nfuture and certain event (art.  1508 C.C.Q. ). The parties are therefore bound as soon as \nthe contract is signed, and the obligation becomes exigible when the term expires \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n (art. 1513 C.C.Q. ). A condition and a term are different, because with a condition t he \noccurrence of the event is uncertain, whereas with a term the event is certain but the \ndate may not be . The characterization of an event as a condition requires two kinds of \nuncertainty: objective, because the occurrence of the event must be objectively  \nuncertain, but also subjective, because the parties must not have taken the occurrence \nof the event as certain . Thus, the parties’ state of mind with respect to whether the \noccurrence of the event is certain or uncertain can serve to distinguish a term fr om a \ncondition . \n In this case, the agreement imposes an obligation with a suspensive term \non the City . The circumstances in which the agreement was entered into show that the \nparties intended compensation for the credited area of land making up the bank to be \ndependent on future cadastral operations and that they  were convinced those operations \nwould take place.  The two parties therefore had a common vision regarding future real \nestate developments on the City’s territory and regarding an impending use of the area \nbank.  The trial judge erred in focusing solely on the objectively uncertain nature of \nfuture cadastral operations in order to characterize the City’s obligation. To properly \ndistinguish an obligation with a term from a conditional obligation in th is case, it was \nimportant to consider the occurrence of the event in a subjective sense as well, that is, \nthe question of whether, in the parties’ minds, future cadastral operations were certain . \n When a term is defined by reference to the occurrence of a future event and \nthe event does not occur, arts.  1512 and 1510 C.C.Q.  allow the term to be fixed \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n judicially on a specific date. Article 1512 para.  1 C.C.Q.  states that where “the parties \nhave agreed to delay the determination of the term or to leave it to one of them to make \nsuch determination and where, after a reasonable time, no term has been determined, \nthe court may, upon the application of one of the parties, fix the term according to the \nnature of the obligation, the situation of the parties and any appropriate circumstances .” \nThis paragraph contemplates a situation where the parties have decided on a term by \nreference to an event that is considered certain, without knowing when it will occur. \nArticle 1510 C.C.Q. , for its part, provides that “[i]f the  event that was considered \ncertain does not occur, the obligation is exigible from the day on which the event \nnormally should have occurred",

    "text": " \nnature of the obligation, the situation of the parties and any appropriate circumstances .” \nThis paragraph contemplates a situation where the parties have decided on a term by \nreference to an event that is considered certain, without knowing when it will occur. \nArticle 1510 C.C.Q. , for its part, provides that “[i]f the  event that was considered \ncertain does not occur, the obligation is exigible from the day on which the event \nnormally should have occurred.” Three conditions must be met for the principle in \nart. 1510  C.C.Q.  to apply: (1)  the parties must have decided on a term by reference to \nan event that was considered certain; (2)  the day must be determinable; and (3)  it must \nhave become impossible for the event that was considered certain to occur. Article 1512 \npara.  1 and art.  1510 C.C.Q.  are mutually exclusive.  \n Article 1512 para.  1 C.C.Q.  applies in this case . Having regard to the nature \nof the obligation, the situation of the parties and any appropriate circumstances, the \nterm must be fixed at the time of the demand letter sent to the City by Laroda, that is, \nat De cember  15, 2015. The first paragraph’s conditions for fixing the term are met: \nLaroda asked the court in its originating application to fix the term; the parties did not \nfix the date on which the term would occur and left it to themselves to make this \ndetermination later; the term was potestative, insofar  as the occurrence of the event that \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n was considered certain depended on the parties’ conduct ; and the parties did not, after \na reasonable time, establish when the term would occur.  \n With regard to the remed y, restitution of prestations takes place where a \nperson is bound by law to return to another person property received (1)  without right \nor in error; (2)  under a juridical act which is subsequently annulled with retroactive \neffect; or (3)  under a juridical  act whose  obligations become impossible to perform by \nreason of superior force (art.  1699 para.  1 C.C.Q. ). None of these scenarios applies in \nthis case; it therefore could not be asserted, as the Court of Appeal did, that the City \nhad to return the excess area received to Larochelle . It is necessary to turn instead to \nthe performance by equivalence regime set out in arts.  1607 et seq. C.C.Q. , which gives \nthe creditor the right to obtain damages for injury caused by the debtor’ s failure to \ncomply with its obligation.  The injury sustained by Laroda lies in being deprived of the \nvalue of the land transferred to the City, which used it without having to pay a single \ncent to acquire it. This justifies monetary compensation equivalen t to the market value \nof an area of 26,705.78  m2 of bulk land free of park fees on the territory of Ville de \nSainte -Julie at the time the obligation became exigible, that is, on the date of the \ndemand letter of December  15, 2015 . Because the evidence in th e record does not make \nit possible to determine this value , the case should be remanded to the Superior Court \nso that a finding can be made on this question.  \nCases Cited  \n Referred to:  Lalonde  v.

Overview  \n[1] This appeal and the cross -appeal require the Court to consider a number of \nconcepts from the law of obligations in the context of an agreement (“agreement”, \nreproduced in Appendix A) entered into by a municipality, Ville de Sainte -Julie \n(“City”), and a developer, Promotions M.G.  Larochelle inc. (“Larochelle”), concerning \nthe development of land in the municipality. The parties to the agreement cr eated an \n“area bank” that was to be applied in compensation for future park fees to be paid to \nthe City in connection with new real estate developments by the developer. In the end, \nthose developments never took place, and the respondent, Investissements L aroda inc. \n(“Laroda”), the successor to Larochelle’s rights, titles and interests, turned to the courts \nto seek compensation for the value of that bank.  \n[2] In the courts below, the debate focused primarily on three points, namely \n(1) the question of whether n ovation had been effected against a pre -existing debt, \n(2) the existence of an obligation with a term or a conditional obligation, and (3)  the \nnature of the remedy to which the respondent was entitled, if any. Through their various \ngrounds of appeal, the p arties are challenging the Court of Appeal’s conclusions on \neach of these points. They are asking this Court to decide several grounds of appeal \nrelating to the agreement, including its characterization, its interpretation and the \nremedy to which Laroda ma y be entitled given that the “area bank” was never used.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n [3] Therefore, in order to dispose of the appeal and the cross -appeal, it must \nfirst be determined whether the agreement effected novation of a prior debt. Upon \nanalysis, I conclude that this is the case . In my opinion, the agreement extinguished the \nCity’s prior debt for excess land mistakenly transferred to the City and, by formalizing \nthe establishment of an “area bank”, transformed that initial obligation into a new \ncontractual obligation, thereby cre ating a distinct obligational relationship based on the \nterms of the agreement. This alteration of the obligation satisfies the legal criteria for \nnovation, particularly an intention to substitute a new obligation for the former one and \na substantial chang e in the legal relationship.  \n[4] Next, it is important to consider the legal nature of the obligation arising \nfrom the agreement: Is it an obligation with a term, whose exigibility is deferred in \ntime, or a conditional obligation, which depends on an uncertain  event? In this case, I \nam of the view that the parties agreed on an obligation with a suspensive term. In other \nwords,  the City’s obligation to effect compensation for the value of the “area bank” \nwould not become exigible until the occurrence of events t hat the parties considered \ncertain, namely cadastral operations allowing for new real estate developments . \n[5] That being the case, the term was indeterminate because the parties did not \nknow when those cadastral operations would take place, such that it becom es necessary",

Having regard to the nature of the City’s obligation, the situation of the parties \nand the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the term must be fixed at December  15, \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n 2015, when Laroda sent the City a demand letter. It was on tha t date that the City’s \nobligation with a term became exigible.  \n[6] As for the remedy to which Laroda is entitled, the applicable regime must \nbe determined: Is it restitution of prestations or performance by equivalence? Given the \nfact that novation extinguishe d the debt resulting from the excess land received by the \nCity that was mistakenly transferred by Larochelle, I am of the view that the restitution \nof prestations regime does not apply to this area of land (3,898.27  m2). Rather, it is the \nperformance by eq uivalence regime that applies here, both for the excess received by \nthe City and for the additional area of land (22,807.5  m2) transferred later. As a result, \nLaroda is entitled to damages equivalent to the market value of the area recognized in \nthe bank, which is to say vacant bulk land free of park fees, as it stood on the date of \nthe term fixed, that is, at the time of the demand letter sent to the City by Laroda on \nDecember  15, 2015.  \n[7] However, the evidence in the record does not make it possible to deter mine \nthe market value as of December  15, 2015, of the area recognized in the bank. The case \nshould therefore be remanded to the Superior Court on this question alone so that \nevidence can be adduced in this regard, unless of course the parties come to an \nagreement on the market value as of December  15, 2015.  \n[8] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal, allow the \ncross -appeal in part and order the City to pay Laroda the market value of the land as of \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n \n December  15, 2015. This value is to be determin ed by the Superior Court, to which the \ncase is remanded on this question alone.  \nII. Background  \n[9] Larochelle and the City had a long -standing collaborative relationship, \nmarked by the carrying out of many real estate development projects over the years. \nDuring th e 1990s, Larochelle completed several of those projects on the City’s \nterritory. In December 2000, the total area of the projects so completed by Larochelle \nwas 760,926.3  m2. \n[10] Pursuant to the statutory and by -law provisions in force governing this type \nof development, Larochelle was required to transfer 10% of that area to the City for the \npurposes of parks, playgrounds or green spaces or, alternatively, to pay the City a sum \nequivalent thereto ( Act respecting land use planning and development , S.Q. 1979, \nc. 51, s.  115 para.  2(8) (then in force); By -law No.  701, Règlement de lotissement  \n(1991)).  \n[11] Once those developments had been completed, the City and Larochelle \nwanted to take stock of the area that had actually been transferred during the various \ndevelopment  phases. The result of that assessment was that Larochelle had transferred \nto the City 3,898.27  m2 more than it was legally required to transfer for the purposes \nof parks, playgrounds or green spaces (“excess transfer”). At that time, the City stated \nthat it was unable to return the land or to reimburse its value to Larochelle.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n [12] It is important to note at the outset that, with regard to this “excess \ntransfer”, the restitution of prestations regime applied at the time because this was \nsimply a case of receipt",

At that time, the City stated \nthat it was unable to return the land or to reimburse its value to Larochelle.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n [12] It is important to note at the outset that, with regard to this “excess \ntransfer”, the restitution of prestations regime applied at the time because this was \nsimply a case of receipt  of a payment not due. However, no restitution was made at the \ntime the events occurred, either in kind (i.e., land) or by equivalence (i.e., money). The \nCity was unable to make such restitution at that time.  \n[13] During the same period, the City expressed its interest in another parcel of \nland owned by Larochelle, as it wished to complete certain public amenities, including \na bicycle path. That desired parcel of land had an area of 45,615  m2, half of which was \nbuildable. The City indicated that it did not have the means to purchase the land and \nasked Larochelle to finance the land for it.  \n[14] The City and Larochelle began negotiations to deal with these two matters, \nthat is, the “excess transfer” of 3,898.27  m2 and the financing for the additional area of \n45,615  m2, of which 22,807.5  m2 were buildable. On February  19, 2001, the parties \ntherefore entered into an agreement whose terms were drafted exclusively by the City, \nthrough which they agreed to create a land bank in favour of Larochelle. The creation \nof this bank  spared the City from having to immediately fulfill its obligations to \nLarochelle, that is, compensating Larochelle for the “excess transfer” of 3,898.27  m2 \nand paying for the acquisition of the 45,615  m2 parcel of land given that Larochelle had \nagreed to provide the financing requested by the City for that parcel.  \n[15] Thus, the parties created a bank to deal with the two matters referred to \nabove. Article 4 of the agreement provided that Larochelle [ TRANSLATION ] “undertakes \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n to transfer 45,615 square metres, 50 % of which is applicable to this protocol, that is, \n22,807.5 square metres”, and article 5 provided that “[t]he transferee [City] agrees that \nthe transferor [Larochelle] has created a bank of 26,705.78 square metres”, that is, the \ntotal of the area of 22,8 07.5 m2 referred to in article 4 and the excess 3,898.27  m2 \nreceived (A.R., vol.  II, at pp.  136-37 (emphasis deleted)). Moreover, the resolution of \nthe City’s municipal council approving the agreement stated that [ TRANSLATION ] “this \nagreement will create a  bank for the purposes of parks or playgrounds for future \napprovals of cadastral operations” (p.  138). Lastly, it is important to note that the \nagreement did not include any mechanism in the event that specific performance of the \nCity’s obligation proved t o be impossible.  \n[16] At the time of entering into the agreement, Larochelle did not own any land \nthat could be developed on the City’s territory. However, this was not the case for its \nsubsidiary, Laroda,1 which owned lots in an agricultural zone forming part of a sector \nof the City called “Du Moulin” (hereinafter “Du Moulin sector”) with an area of \n143,000  m2. It was therefore expected that Laroda could use part of the 26,705.78  m2 \nland bank for a future cadastral operation on the lots it owned. However, it is  important \nto note that the agreement did not impose any specific limitation on how any future \ndevelopment would take place.  \n[17] Because this area of 143,000  m2 was in an agricultural zone, an application \nfor exclusion from the agricultural zone had to be made  to and approved by the \n                                                 \n1 In 2010, a corporate reorganization resulted in Laroda becoming the holder  and beneficiary of all of \nLarochell e’s rights, titles and interests and , consequently,  of the bank of 26,705.78  m2. \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n---",

The parties sincerely \nbelieved that there would be no difficulty with that application for e xclusion, since all \nof the applications previously made by the City to the CPTAQ with respect to lots \nowned by Larochelle or its subsidiaries had been granted. The Court of Appeal referred \nto this, stating that [ TRANSLATION ] “both Larochelle and the City w ere convinced that \nthe same would be true of this one” (2023 QCCA 1294, at para.  11) and that “[i]t was \nnot even contemplated that this authorization might be denied” (para.  39). \n[18] It was in this context that, in February 2003, the City filed a first applica tion \nwith the CPTAQ to have the land targeted by the proposed development excluded from \nthe agricultural zone. On March  22, 2004, that application was denied. On \nNovember  12, 2008, a second application for exclusion suffered the same fate.2 That \ndecision w as confirmed by the Administrative Tribunal of Québec (“ATQ”) on \nJune 14, 2011. In short, the applications for dezoning failed. Despite this, however, the \nparties continued thereafter to discuss the land bank and ways of making its use \npossible.  \n[19] In 2012, t he Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal adopted the \nMetropolitan Land Use and Development Plan (“MLUDP”), which limited \ndevelopment in agricultural zones for a period of at least 10 years. That plan thus \n                                                 \n2 The land of 22,807.5 m2 was the subject of two separate transfers to the City, in  2007 and in  2010.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n restricted Laroda’s ability to file an application for approval of a cadastral operation \nwith the City.  \n[20] After the MLUDP was adopted, Laroda tried to acquire other parcels of \nland within the City’s urbanization perimeter so that it could use the bank, but its \nattempts failed.  \n[21] On December  15, 2015, Laroda, t hrough its representative, sent a demand \nletter to the City’s mayor. In the letter, the representative complained of [ TRANSLATION ] \n“the impossibility of applying these 26,705.78 square metres” (A.R., vol.  III, at p.  136). \nHe noted that the situation did no t look much better for the future: [ TRANSLATION ] “. . . \naccording to what we were told by the director of urban planning at our last meeting, \nwith the new urban planning scales, it is inconceivable to have a new sector without \nthe possibility of having an area of 10% set aside for the purposes of parks and \nplaygrounds” (p.  136). Laroda’s representative concluded by asking the City to \n[TRANSLATION ] “finalize the matter” and “presen[t] a monetary offer” to it (A.R., \nvol. III, at p.  136).  \n[22] Following unsuccessful discussions with the City, Laroda filed an \noriginating application against it on December  13, 2018, asking the court to fix the \nexpiry of the term specified in the agreement and to award compensatory damages in \nits favour.  \nIII.

    "text": "S 3573 (Courchesne  J.) \n[23] The trial judge dismissed the originating application for a declaratory \njudgment and damages filed by Laroda. The City was therefore released from any \nobligation arising from the agreement.  \n[24] Looking firs t at the prior debt resulting from the excess received by the \nCity, the judge found that the agreement was actually a transaction because its purpose \nwas to prevent a future dispute between the City and Larochelle with regard to that \ndebt. According to the  judge, that transaction automatically effected novation by a \nchange in debt pursuant to art.  1660 of the Civil Code of Québec  (“C.C.Q. ”). In her \nview, the agreement therefore had the effect of extinguishing any obligation that the \nCity might have toward L arochelle to return the excess area received, and created a \nnew obligational relationship between the parties.  \n[25] The judge found from the evidence that because the City had refused to pay \nthe monetary value of the excess area received, the agreement had crea ted an “area \nbank” that was to be applied at the time of future cadastral operations by Larochelle \nand its subsidiaries. In the judge’s opinion, this was the only method of using the bank \nstipulated in the agreement.  \n[26] With regard to how the agreement was to  be performed, the Superior Court \nfound that the obligation resulting from it was conditional on the approval of cadastral \noperations, that is, a future and uncertain event which had not occurred and for which \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n the parties had not stipulated any term. To su pport this finding, the judge considered \nthe context and the parties’ intention at the time the agreement was signed. The \noccurrence of future cadastral operations could not be considered objectively certain, \nbecause it depended on an exercise of discretio n by an administrative body responsible \nfor assessing applications for the exclusion of lots from an agricultural zone. Despite \ntheir high level of confidence, the parties could not regard the outcome of the \napplication to the CPTAQ as certain. This observ ation also applied to the acquisition \nby Larochelle or its subsidiaries of land in a residential zone. According to the judge, \nthe evidence showed that the fulfilment of the condition, that is, the filing by Laroda of \nan application for approval of a cadas tral operation, had become impossible. The judge \ntherefore held that the City was released from its obligations.  \n[27] However, the judge stated that if she had found that the obligation was one \nwith a term, then the future event on which the exigibility of the City’s obligation \ndepended would have had to occur at the latest in 2012, after the failure of the \napplications for exclusion of the Du Moulin sector from the agricultural zone and the \nadoption, by the metropolitan regional community, of a policy aimed at limiting the \nuse of agricultural land for urban development purposes. The judge therefore found \nthat this date would be the one to use for fixing the term. However, because the action \nhad been instituted by Laroda in December 2018, she was of the view that  the action \nwould be prescribed under art.  2925 C.C.Q.  \nB. Quebec Court of Appeal, 2023 QCCA 1294 (Marcotte, Hogue and Moore  JJ.A.)  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n [28] The Court of Appeal allowed Laroda’s appeal and ordered the City to pay \nit $287,458.51.  \n[29] The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred in law by finding \nthat the agreement, recognized by the parties as being a transaction, had automatically \neffected novation and extinguished the City’s obligation to return the excess it had \nreceived. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the part ies’ goal had not been to extinguish \nthe City’s obligation, but rather to delay when the performance of the obligation would \nbe exigible. Given that the parties were convinced that Larochelle would develop a new \nparcel of land and that this was not an unce rtain event, the parties had made the City’s \nobligation subject to a term rather than a condition. To arrive at this finding, the court \nnoted that the objective uncertainty of an event was not enough to make the event a \ncondition, as the parties themselves  would also have had to consider it uncertain. \nHowever, this was not the case here.

To arrive at this finding, the court \nnoted that the objective uncertainty of an event was not enough to make the event a \ncondition, as the parties themselves  would also have had to consider it uncertain. \nHowever, this was not the case here. The ATQ’s decision upholding the CPTAQ’s \nrefusal to exclude the Du Moulin sector from the agricultural zone in 2011 did not \nexhaust the other possibilities for using the ba nk and, at that time, the City could still \nbenefit from the term stipulated in its favour. Indeed, the Court of Appeal noted that \nthe parties had continued their discussions on the use of the bank and had looked for \nways to make its use possible, even afte r the ATQ’s decision. Consequently, the City’s \nobligation with a term was still not exigible in 2011, and Laroda’s action thus could \nnot be prescribed as the trial judge had held.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n [30] To determine when the City’s obligation with a term had become exigible, \nthe Court of Appeal applied arts.  1510 and 1512 C.C.Q.  simultaneously. Although the \nparties considered the development of the land certain, and although this event \nconstituted the term to which the City’s obligation was subject, the Court of Appeal \nfound that  the time of this event remained undetermined. Neither of the parties could \ndetermine when the City’s obligation, suspended up to that point, had become exigible \nor the manner in which the bank would be used. In such circumstances, it was therefore \nnecessa ry, in the Court of Appeal’s opinion, for one of the parties to go to court to have \nthe term fixed. The trial court’s intervention thus served to make the obligation exigible \nand to cause extinctive prescription to begin running. The Court of Appeal held t hat \nthe term could not be fixed at a time prior to the commencement of the proceedings, in \norder to prevent the parties from losing rights without having been able to take the \nnecessary steps to protect them. Laroda’s application therefore could not be pre scribed.  \n[31] With regard to the remedy, the Court of Appeal determined that the rules \nof the restitution regime applied. This was because it was not possible to establish when \nthe City should have returned the excess land received. Moreover, the parties had \nprovided only for restitution of the excess land received by the City, without creating \nany alternative mechanism for indemnification or restitution by equivalence. Insofar as \nthe factual situation no longer allowed for such restitution, the Court of Appeal held \nthat the value of the excess received by the City had to be determined as of the time \nwhen Larochelle had transferred the land. Since there was no evidence from which the \nvalue at that time could be established, the Court of Appeal used the value list ed on the \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n \n municipal roll for 2001. It therefore held that the City had to pay $287,458.51 to \nLaroda, as the beneficiary of Larochelle’s rights.  \nIV. Issues  \n[32] To dispose of this appeal and this cross -appeal, the Court must answer the \nfollowing questions:  \nA. Did the a greement effect novation of the City’s pre -existing obligation \nresulting from the excess 3,898.27  m2 of land received by the City?  \nB. Did the agreement  create an obligation with a term or a conditional \nobligation? If it created an obligation with a term, at w hat point in time \nmust the term be fixed?  \nC. To what remedy  is the respondent entitled?  \nV. Analysis  \nA. Did the Agreement Effect Novation of the City’s Pre -existing Obligation \nResulting From the Excess 3,898.27  m2 of Land Received by the City?  \n[33] It must first be deter mined whether the pre -existing obligation relating to \nthe excess 3,898.27  m2 of land received by the City was extinguished. This question \nmust be resolved first because this is a preliminary step in deciding another question in \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n \n issue.

The fact is that the City and Laroda both disagree with the Court of Appeal’s \nconclusion that the restitution of prestations regime applies in this case, arguing instead \nthat the performance by equivalence regime should apply if this Court were to conclude \nthat the value of th e “area bank” must be reimbursed. However, the subsistence of the \ninitial debt or its extinction by novation determines whether it is the restitution of \nprestations regime or the performance by equivalence regime that applies, because if \nthe pre -existing d ebt relating to the excess 3,898.27  m2 of land received by the City \nwas extinguished, then it goes without saying that restitution for that debt is not \nnecessary.  \n[34] To determine whether the pre -existing obligation was extinguished through \nnovation, I begin b y reviewing the applicable legal principles. After completing this \nreview, I conclude that the agreement effected novation by a change in debt and thus \nextinguished the prior debt relating to the land.  \n(1) Concept of Novation  \n[35] Novation is an alteration of an ob ligation that originates in Roman law \n(J.-P. Lévy and A.  Castaldo, Histoire du droit civil  (2nd ed. 2010), at Nos.  719-22). \nThis operation has two distinct and simultaneous legal consequences: the extinction of \nthe initial relationship, without payment, an d the creation of a relationship that is both \nnew and different (J. -L. Baudouin and P. -G. Jobin, Les obligations  (7th ed. 2013), by \nP.-G. Jobin and N.  Vézina, at No.  994; D. Lluelles and B. Moore, Droit des obligations  \n(3rd ed. 2018), at No.  3072). Novatio n involves an [ TRANSLATION ] “organized \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n \n severing” of the initial obligational relationship (Lluelles and Moore, at No.  3072 \n(emphasis deleted)).  \n[36] The civil law of Quebec sets out the principles relating to novation in \narts. 1660 to 1666 C.C.Q.  (reproduced in  Appendix B). Three types of novation are \nprovided for in art.  1660 C.C.Q. : (1) novation by a change in debt; (2)  novation by a \nchange in debtor; and finally, the last type, which is rarer, (3)  novation by a change in \ncreditor. I am concerned more specific ally with novation by a change in debt, because \nthe trial judge found that this was the type of novation effected in this case.  \n(2) Novation by a Change in Debt  \n[37] Novation by a change in debt occurs when the debtor contracts, towards its \ncreditor, a new debt that is substituted for the former one, which is then extinguished . \nIn this scenario, the same debtor binds itself to the same creditor by assuming a new \nobligation (and not simply a modified obligation), while being released from the former \none (Baudouin,  Jobin and Vézina, at No.  998).  \n[38] Novation by a change in debt may result from a change in the cause, object \nor modalities of the obligation, as long as the new obligation has a [ TRANSLATION ] \n“truly new element” when compared to the former one (Baudouin, Job in and Vézina, \nat No.  998). The change therefore cannot be one that merely adds an extra element to \nthe former obligation or simply a change in form (No. 998). \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n \n (3) Conditions for Novation  \n[39] In Lalonde v.

Faribault, Traité de \ndroit civil du Québec , vol.  8 (1959), at No.  677):  \n  [TRANSLATION ] For there to be novation five conditions must be met:  \n  1. there must be a prior obligation, 2.  a new obligation must be created, \n3. these two obligations must be different from each other, 4.  the parties \nmust have indicated their intention to novate, and 5.  they must hav e the \ncapacity to enter into a contract.  \n[40] These principles are still relevant today. The provisions on novation in \narts. 1660 to 1666 of the Civil Code of  Québec  did not substantively change  the content \nof the rules on novation set out in the Civil Code of Lower Canada . While arts.  1660 to \n1666 C.C.Q.  do not include a specific provision stating that novation must be effected \nbetween persons capable of contracting, as was formerly stated in art.  1170 C.C.L.C. , \nthis condition remains in effect, because it is a n essential condition of contract \nformation. Logically, since novation is carried out through a contract (Lluelles and \nMoore, at No.  3087), its conditions of formation must be met in order for novation to \nbe validly effected.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n \n [41] I have already referred to the  principle relating to the criterion of a new \nelement between the two debts in the context of novation by a change in debt. I will \nnow look more specifically at the principle relating to the parties’ intention.  \n(4) Parties’ Intention to Novate  \n[42] For novation to be effected, the parties must have had the [ TRANSLATION ] \n“clear and unequivocal” intention to extinguish the existing debt and to create a new \none that is different from the first ( Banque Laurentienne du Canada v. Mackay , [2002] \nR.J.Q. 365 (C.A.), at para.  26). This condition is set out in art.  1661 C.C.Q. , which \nprovides as follows: “ Novation is not presumed; the intention to effect it must be \nevident. ” Thus, novation cannot result from a combination of circumstances or an \nunintentional act by the parties (Intégration de réseaux M.I.R. inc. (Faillite de) , 2001 \nCanLII 24879 (Que. Sup.  Ct.)). \n[43] While the intention to novate must be evident, this does not require that it \nbe confirmed in writing. It may be tacit, which is to say that it may [ TRANSLATION ] \n“result from behaviour or conduct by the creditor that clearly demonstrates its intention \nto discharge the original debtor” ( Mackay , at para.  24, citing Rémy  v. Gagnon , [1971] \nC.A. 554 (Que.), at p.  557; Chamberland (Syndic de) , [1988] R.J.Q. 1159 (C.A.); Trust \nGénéral du Canada  v.

Ct.)).  \n[44] The high threshold of proof for establishing the intention to novate is based \non the fact that the extinction of the former debt entail s a renunciation by the creditor \nof the benefit of its rights resulting from the former debt. In this context, since \nrenunciation cannot be presumed (art.  646 C.C.Q. ), the same must be true of the \nintention to novate (art.  1661 C.C.Q. ). Accordingly, unless  there is “clear and \nunequivocal” evidence revealing the parties’ intention to novate, a solution that \npreserves the creditor’s rights must be preferred, and it must be found that novation has \nnot been effected ( Mackay , at para.  26). \n(5) Application  \n[45] I must dec ide whether, on the basis of the principles I have just outlined, it \ncan be concluded that the agreement effected novation of the pre -existing obligation \nrelating to the excess 3,898.27  m2 of land received by the City. In this case, only the \ncriteria of the parties’ intention and the new element need to be considered.  \n[46] The Court of Appeal found that the new agreement did not include a new \nelement between the debts; rather, the new debt was m erely an extension of the former \none. Furthermore, in its opinion, the parties had no intention of extinguishing the \nformer debt. In contrast, the parties argue that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that \nthe agreement was an extension of a single debt owed by the City to Larochelle. They \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n submit that the agreement can be characterized as a transaction with respect to the \nexcess 3,898.27  m2 received, since its purpose was to prevent a future contestation. \nThey add that their intention was to extinguish th e obligation in its initial form and \nreplace it with a new obligation. The Court of Appeal found that the question of whether \nthe agreement could be characterized as a transaction was not in issue. For my part, I \nam of the view that the agreement is not a transaction, but simply a contract. In any \nevent, this question is of little relevance because there is no need to decide it in order \nto determine whether novation extinguished the City’s debt to Larochelle for the excess \n3,898.27  m2 received.  \n[47] Respectfully , I agree with the parties that the Court of Appeal erred in \nholding that novation had not been effected in this case. The parties’ intention in \nentering into the agreement was, in part, to extinguish the City’s debt to Larochelle \nresulting from the excess  3,898.27  m2 received and transform it into a new debt \nfundamentally different from the first. I will explain.  \n(a) Context Before the Agreement Was Entered Into  \n[48] The agreement covered two aspects.  \n[49] The first aspect arose from the fact that Larochelle had mistake nly \ntransferred an excess area of 3,898.27  m2 to the City as a transfer for the purposes of \nparks, playgrounds and green spaces. I reiterate that this excess 3,898.27  m2 was \nreceived as a result of development projects in the 1990s for which Larochelle was  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n required to transfer the equivalent of 10% of the total area of the projects to the City \nfor the purposes of parks, playgrounds and green spaces. The excess 3,898.27  m2 \nreceived therefore reflects the difference between the area actually transferred by \nLarochelle and the area required to be transferred under By -law No.  701. \n[50] However, this aspect was not the only one negotiated by the City and \nLarochelle at the time. As explained above, the City, wishing to complete certain \namenities, including a bicycle pat h, wanted Larochelle to transfer a 45,615  m2 parcel \nof land to it, which Larochelle agreed to do even though the City was unable to pay it \nat the time. Larochelle thus agreed to finance the City. This area, which had initially \nbeen included in an urban dev elop",

    "text": " the City and \nLarochelle at the time. As explained above, the City, wishing to complete certain \namenities, including a bicycle pat h, wanted Larochelle to transfer a 45,615  m2 parcel \nof land to it, which Larochelle agreed to do even though the City was unable to pay it \nat the time. Larochelle thus agreed to finance the City. This area, which had initially \nbeen included in an urban dev elopment plan tabled in 1998, was transferred by \nLarochelle in a context where it wanted compensation to be effected by the City when \nnew transfers for the purposes of parks, playgrounds or green spaces would be required \nin connection with future cadastral  operations.  \n[51] These two aspects therefore formed the backdrop to the discussions that \nled the parties to enter into the 2001 agreement.  \n(b) With Regard to the Excess Received, the Parties Intended to Be Bound by \na New Debt  \n[52] Although the agreement says nothing about novation, an analysis of the \ncircumstances in which it was entered into reveals that the parties had the common \nintention of extinguishing the prior debt resulting from the excess received in order to \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n replace it with a new obligation. At the time the  agreement was signed, the City \nacknowledged that it was unable to reimburse to Larochelle either the value of the \nadditional area of land or the value corresponding to the excess 3,898.27  m² received, \nwhile also expressing a wish to continue the developme nt of its territory using other \nland that was owned by Larochelle and that it hoped to acquire. As for Larochelle, it \nintended to continue its development activities on the City’s territory while seeking a \nform of compensation for the excess it had transfe rred. \n[53] The City and Larochelle therefore agreed to enter into a contract — the \nagreement — that would establish a mechanism to effect compensation for the excess \nland transferred by Larochelle (A.R., vol.  II, at pp.  135 et seq.) as well as formalize the \ntransfer and financing of the additional area the City wanted in order to complete its \namenities. This mechanism took the form of a land bank (also called “area bank” in \nthese reasons).  \n[54] For an understanding of how the parties intended to use the bank, it is \nimportant to look to the testimony of Laroda’s representative — the only person who \ntestified regarding the circumstances in which the agreement was entered into. The \nparties agreed that this “area bank” would be used at the time of future cadastral \noperati ons by Larochelle or Laroda. In this regard, Laroda’s representative in fact \ndescribed the bank as “financing” in consideration for the transferred area. This \ninterpretation is confirmed by the minutes of the City’s municipal council (appended \nto the agree ment) stating that “this agreement will create a bank for the purposes of \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n parks or playgrounds for future approvals of cadastral operations” (A.R., vol.  II, at \np. 138).  \n[55] In this context, the bank must be seen as a form of credit, which required \nthe City to effect compensation for future debts for parks, playgrounds or green spaces \nusing the negotiated and agreed area making up the bank. As the Superior Court judge \nnoted, it was only by carrying out future cadastral operations that the parties could use \nthe “ area bank” provided for in the agreement (para.  37). \n[56] We are thus dealing with novation by a change in debt, which produces the \nsame effects as an acquittance for the prior debt resulting from the excess 3,898.27  m² \nreceived — a debt that arose under the ru les on receipt of a payment not due (arts.  1491 \nand 1492 C.C.Q. ) (see, by analogy, V.  Karim, Les obligations  (6th ed. 2024), vol.  2, at \nNo. 3737). This debt was therefore extinguished. At the same time, a new obligation \narose: the one that combined the 22, 807.5  m² described by the parties as “financing” \nand the former debt of 3,898.27  m², thereby creating a new total debt of 26,705.78  m². \nThe former debt thus lost its individuality",

At the same time, a new obligation \narose: the one that combined the 22, 807.5  m² described by the parties as “financing” \nand the former debt of 3,898.27  m², thereby creating a new total debt of 26,705.78  m². \nThe former debt thus lost its individuality within the agreement (see, by analogy, \nBaudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at No.  998; Lluelles and Moore, at No.  3078). The new \ndebt resulting from the agreement arose out of a separate contract independent of the \nprior debt. In other words, the agreement truly wiped the slate clean: the rules on receipt \nof a payment not due no longer go verned the initial debt of 3,898.27  m². The parties \nagreed on a bank, a credit mechanism, that would be applicable from then on to future \ncadastral operations.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n [57] It is therefore apparent that the “area bank”, as well as the parties’ intended \nuse of it, const itutes a new element. This mechanism reflects a common intention by \nthe parties to restructure their contractual relationship — with respect to the question \nof restitution of the payment not due consisting of the area of 3,898.27  m² — in order \nto take bett er account of their respective interests. This situation corresponds to \nnovation by a change in debt: the debt resulting from the “excess transfer” of \n3,898.27  m2 was extinguished and replaced by a new one.  \nB. Did the Agreement Create an Obligation With a Ter m or a Conditional \nObligation for the City? If It Created an Obligation With a Term, at What Point \nin Time Must the Term Be Fixed?  \n[58] I must now determine whether the City’s obligation to credit Larochelle for \nfuture transfers for parks, playgrounds and green  spaces is a conditional obligation \n(arts.  1497 et seq. C.C.Q. ), in which case it never arose, or an obligation with a term \n(arts.  1508 et seq. C.C.Q. ), which had the effect of deferring its exigibility. The \ncharacterization of the City’s obligation as bei ng either conditional or with a term is \nprecisely what will determine whether there must be compensation for the “area bank”.  \n[59] It was only by carrying out future cadastral operations that the parties could \nuse the “area bank” provided for in the agreement. In a context where such cadastral \noperations never took place, the question of whether the City must fulfill its obligation \nis a thorny one. The parties disagree on this.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n [60] Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that the agreement imposes an \nobligation w ith a suspensive term on the City (art.  1508 C.C.Q. ). Since the parties \nconsidered it certain that cadastral operations (and thus the development of new land) \nwould take place even if it was not known when such cadastral operations would occur, \nI find that  they intended to be bound by the expiry of a suspensive term. Indeed, the \nparties chose to defer the exigibility of the City’s obligation until future cadastral \noperations took place; the term was thus for the benefit of the City as debtor (art.  1511 \nC.C.Q.), which did not have to pay anything at that time.  \n[61] Because the term in this case is indeterminate, it is necessary to fix it. In \nmy opinion, the term must be fixed on the basis of art.  1512 C.C.Q.  and not art.  1510 \nC.C.Q.  Article 1510 C.C.Q.  requires th at the times at which the cadastral operations \nwould take place be determinable and that the occurrence of such operations have \nbecome impossible, which cannot be ascertained from the evidence in the record. As \nfor art.  1512 C.C.Q. , it allows the term to b e fixed according to the nature of the \nobligation, the situation of the parties and any appropriate circumstances. In this case, \nthe term must be fixed at the time of the demand letter sent to the City by Laroda, that \nis, at December  15, 201",

In this case, \nthe term must be fixed at the time of the demand letter sent to the City by Laroda, that \nis, at December  15, 2015.  \n(1) Obligations With a Simple Modality  \n[62] The modalities of an obligation concern the time limit for performance, the \nnumber of parties involved or the number of prestations to be performed (Lluelles and \nMoore, at No.  2459). An obligation with a simple modality — as opposed to a complex \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n modality involving multiple persons or prestations — can be either conditional or with \na term.  \n(a) Conditional Obligation (Articles 1497 et Seq. C.C.Q.)  \n[63] An obligation is conditional where its creation or its extinction depends on \na future and unce rtain event (art.  1497 C.C.Q. ). This event is extrinsic to the legal \nrelationship between the parties, which means that it is an autonomous and independent \nevent that does not entail any undertaking by the contracting parties ( Pincourt (Ville \nde) v. Constr uction Cogerex ltée , 2013 QCCA 1773, at para.  132, quoting Roy v. Caisse \npopulaire de Percé , 2003 CanLII 71979 (Que. C.A.) ; see also Lluelles and Moore, at \nNo. 2467).  \n[64] The condition may be suspensive or extinctive. When it is extinctive, the \nobligation is l iable to disappear should the event occur (Lluelles and Moore, at \nNo. 2463; 144286 Canada inc. v. 9121 -6788 Québec inc. , 2009 QCCA 2398, at \nparas.  45-46). In the case of a suspensive condition, the creation of the relationship \nbetween the parties is delayed, and the obligation cannot arise before the condition is \nfulfilled ( 144286 Canada inc. , at paras.  45-46). Thus, before the event occurs, the \nparties are not bound by any obligation, which means that the prospective debtor is safe \nfrom any recourse for payment by the other contracting party ( Placements Marc \nLaplante inc. v. Gagnon , 1996 CanLII 6540  (Que. C.A.), at p.  10; Lluelles and Moore, \nat No.  2464). Moreover, if it becomes certain that the event will not occur, the condition \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n fails (art.  1501 C.C.Q.). There is then no obligation between the parties (Baudouin, \nJobin and Vézina, at No.  596).  \n(b) Obligation With a Term (Articles 1508 et Seq. C.C.Q.)  \n[65] An obligation with a suspensive term is an obligation that arises \nimmediately but whose exigibility is sus pended for a length of time defined by \nreference to a date on the calendar, a precisely identified period or the occurrence of a \nfuture and certain event (art.  1508 C.C.Q. ; J. Pineau et al., Théorie des obligations  (5th \ned. 2023), by C.  Valcke , at No.  1356 ). The parties are therefore bound as soon as the \ncontract is signed (Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at No.  566). The obligation becomes \nexigible when the term expires (art.  1513 C.C.Q. ). \n[66] A condition and a term are different, because with a condition the \noccu rrence of the event is uncertain, whereas with a term the event is certain but the \ndate may not be ( Municipalité de Sainte -Béatrix v. Fabrique de la paroisse de \nSaint -Pierre -de-Belles -Montagnes , 2018 QCCA 553, at paras.  16-17; Commentaires \ndu ministre de l a Justice , vol.

I, Le Code civil du Québec — Un mouvement de société  \n(1993), at p.  927). The characterization of an event as a condition requires two kinds of \nuncertainty: objective, because the occurrence of the event must be objectively \nuncertain, but al so subjective, because the parties must not have taken the occurrence \nof the event as certain ( Venne v. Quebec (Commission de protection du territoire \nagricole) , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 880, at p.  903, quoting J.  Ghestin, “ Réflexions d’un civiliste \nsur la clause d e réserve de propriété ” (1981), 1 Recueil Dalloz Sirey  1, at pp.  4-5). \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n [67] Similarly, authors Didier Lluelles and Benoît Moore (now a justice of the \nQuebec Court of Appeal) explain that the characterization of an obligation as \n“conditional” or “with a term” ma y depend on the circumstances and the likely \nintention of the parties:  \n [TRANSLATION ] The contracting parties may very well regard as a certainty \nan event that would not in itself necessarily be certain to occur if, in their \nminds, they reasonably considered its occurrence to be certain.  . . . [I]f it \nwas clear in the parties’ minds that the event would really take place, why \nnot consider it to be a term? [No.  2503, fn.  10] \n (See also Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at No.  562.)  \n[68] Thus, the parties’ state of mind with respect to whether the occurrence of \nthe event is certain or uncertain can serve to distinguish a term (in the former case) \nfrom a condition (in the latter case) (see, e.g., 9165 -5662 Québec inc. v. 4459181 \nCanada inc. , 2015 QCCA 969, at para.  15; Hiess v. Zelnik , 2019 QCCS 150, at \npara.  34). \n(2) Fixing of the Term  \n(a) Respective Scope of Articles 1512 and 1510 C.C.Q.  \n[69] We have seen that a term can be defined by reference to a specific date, a \nprecisely identified period or the o ccurrence of a future event. In the first two cases, the \nquestion of fixing the term does not arise. The obligation becomes exigible on the day \nspecifically provided for by the parties (arts.  1508, 1509 and 1513 C.C.Q. ). In the third \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n case, the question als o does not arise if the future event on which the term depends \noccurs. On the other hand, if the event does not occur, arts.  1512 and 1510 C.C.Q.  allow \nthe term to be fixed judicially on a specific date (see Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at \nNo. 565 in fine ). The principles relating to the application of each article should be \noutlined.  \n(i) Conditions for the Application of Article 1512 C.C.Q.  \n[70] Article 1512 C.C.Q.  reads as follows:  \n 1512.  Where the parties have agreed to delay the determination of the term \nor to le ave it to one of them to make such determination and where, after a \nreasonable time, no term has been determined, the court may, upon the \napplication of one of the parties, fix the term according to the nature of the \nobligation, the situation of the partie s and any appropriate circumstances.  \n  The court may also fix the term where a term is required by the nature \nof the obligation and there is no agreement as to how it may be determined.  \n[71] Article 1512 C.C.Q.  allows one of the parties to apply to the court to  have \nthe term fixed.

As this Court stated in Uniprix inc. v. Gestion Gosselin  et Bérubé inc. , \n2017 SCC 43, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 59, this provision “applies where there is no term or \nwhere the term is uncertain” (para.  66). \n[72] Before I discuss the principles flowi ng from this provision in greater detail, \nit is important to note that art.  1512 C.C.Q.  specifies that an application by one of the \nparties is required for this article to apply. In other words, art.  1512 C.C.Q.  thus creates \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n \n “an independent remedy that mus t be specifically sought if it is to apply” ( Uniprix , at \npara.  67). \n[73] The two paragraphs of art.  1512 C.C.Q.  presuppose different scenarios: the \nfirst paragraph applies where there is a term — a future and certain event — but where \nthe date on which it will occur is undetermined, while the second paragraph applies \nwhere “there is no term” ( Uniprix , at para.  66), that is, where there is an obligation \nwhose nature requires a term and there is no agreement through which the term can be \ndetermined.  \n[74] The first para graph contemplates a situation where the parties have decided \non a term by reference to an event that is considered certain, without knowing when it \nwill occur (Pineau et al., at No.  1359; Karim, at No.  358; G.  Marchisio, “ Le terme \nindéterminé: réflexions sur une modalité (pas si) simple! ” (2022), 100 Can. Bar Rev.  \n254, at pp.  256-57; Lluelles and Moore, at No.  2505; Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at \nNo. 565). Such terms are called [ TRANSLATION ] “indeterminate”, “unknown”, \n“uncertain” or “undatable” (Pineau et  al., at No.  1357; M.  Tancelin, Des obligations en \ndroit mixte du Québec  (7th ed. 2009), at para.  445; Marchisio, at p.  267; Uniprix , at \npara.  66). \n[75] The classic example of the application of the first paragraph of art.  1512 \nC.C.Q.  is the so -called better fortunes clause, in which a debtor undertakes to repay its \ndebts [ TRANSLATION ] “when able to do so” ( Hiess , at paras.  34-38, quoting Tourangeau \nv. Gatowski , 2004 CanLII 8105 (C.Q.), at paras.  20-29; Richard v. Boucher , 2013 \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n QCCS 3142, at para.  35; F.

In such a situation, the event that the parties consider \ncertain is the attainment by the debtor of sufficient financial capacity to repay its debt, \neven if the time when that sufficient financial capacity will be attained remains \nundetermined. Because capac ity to pay is potestative, insofar as it depends at least in \npart on the conduct of one contracting party, the parties must be taken to “have agreed \nto delay the determination of the term or to leave it to one of them to make such \ndetermination” within the  meaning of art.  1512 para.

Conversely, art.  1510 \nC.C.Q.  will not apply, because [ TRANSLATION ] “[i]t is still possible that the person will \none day have the means to repay their debt” (Levesque, at para.  298).  \n[76] The first paragraph of art.  1512 C.C.Q. also requires that the parties have \neither agreed to delay the determination of the term or left it to one of them to make \nsuch determination, and that no term have been determined after a reasonable time. The \ncondition that the time elapsed be reasonab le prevents the parties from waiting too long \nbefore applying to the court. This condition also prevents anyone from proceeding \nhastily before, for example, the parties have finished negotiating to agree on a term or \nbefore the party with the obligation to  fix a term has had the time to do so (Marchisio, \nat p. 261).  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n [77] Once these conditions are met, the court can fix the term. However, the \nexercise of fixing the term is not purely discretionary, because the court must consider \n“the nature of the obligation, th e situation of the parties and any appropriate \ncircumstances” (Marchisio, at p.  261). These broad criteria provide the court with \nsufficient flexibility, while also serving to prevent arbitrary outcomes (p.  261).  \n[78] The second paragraph of art.  1512 C.C.Q.  applies where “there is no term” \n(Uniprix , at para.  66), that is, in a situation where the parties have not specified any \nterm in their agreement but where a term is required by the nature of the obligation \n(Levesque, at para.  300; Karim, at No.  373; Pineau et al., at No.  1385). One example \nthat comes to mind is a gardener who undertakes in January to come and clean up a \ncustomer’s garden and who, because of the nature of his obligation, cannot be required \nto do so until the fine weather arrives (Lluelles and  Moore, at No.  2510). Further, in \nfixing the term under the second paragraph of art.  1512 C.C.Q. , the court must consider \nthe criteria set out in the first paragraph for this purpose, namely the nature of the \nobligation, the situation of the parties and an y appropriate circumstances ( Péladeau v. \nPlacements Péladeau inc. , 2020 QCCS 1373, at para.  265).  \n(ii) Conditions for the Application of Article 1510 C.C.Q.  \n[79] Article 1510 C.C.Q.  provides as follows:  \n 1510.  If an event that was considered certain does not occur, the obligation \nis exigible from the day on which the event normally should have occurred.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n [80] Three conditions must be met for the principle in art.  1510 to apply. First \nof all, the parties must have decided on a term by reference to an event that was \nconsider ed certain. As we have already explained, this event need not be objectively \ncertain; rather, the parties must have subjectively considered it a certainty that the event \nwould occur.  \n[81] Next, because of the fact that art.  1510 C.C.Q.  requires that the “day on  \nwhich the event normally should have occurred” be identified, a second condition of \nart. 1510 C.C.Q.  is that this day must be determinable (Karim, at No.  363). Indeed, the \nprinciple in art.  1510 C.C.Q.  is intended to provide a solution [ TRANSLATION ] “[w]h ere \nthe parties’ expectations regarding the occurrence of a particular event are frustrated” \n(Pineau et al., at No.  1365).

Indeed, the \nprinciple in art.  1510 C.C.Q.  is intended to provide a solution [ TRANSLATION ] “[w]h ere \nthe parties’ expectations regarding the occurrence of a particular event are frustrated” \n(Pineau et al., at No.  1365). Thus, the court will be able to fix the term under art.  1510 \nC.C.Q.  only if the circumstances show that the parties had contemplated the occurrence \nof the event that they considered certain at a time that was sufficiently precise and \n[TRANSLATION ] “[was] in line with the original intention of the parties” ( Commentaires \ndu ministre de la Justice , at p.  927).  \n[82] Finally, the last condition for the application of art.  1510 C.C.Q.  is that it \nhas become impossible for the event that was considered certain to occur. The term is \ndeterminable, of course, but it remains indeterminate insofar as the parties have \naccepted some uncertainty about when it will occur. It will therefore be nec essary to \nwait until the occurrence of the term has become impossible before fixing it. I note that \nthe impossibility in question here is relative rather than absolute, since absolute \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n impossibility could [ TRANSLATION ] “produce situations in which the oblig ation \nremains dormant for an excessively long period of time, preventing the other \ncontracting party from benefitting from it” (Marchisio, at p.  269). This period of time \nwill necessarily be measured by reference to the determinable time when the term \nnorm ally should have occurred. Furthermore, if the day is determinable, this means that \nthe creditor of the obligation is able to know that, when the occurrence of the event \nconsidered to be certain becomes relatively impossible, it must act to protect its rig hts \nand prevent the operation of prescription against the obligation, which will begin to run \nat the time the event normally would have occurred ( Pellerin Savitz LLP v. Guindon , \n2017 SCC 29, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 575, at para.  12; Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at \nNo. 1127).  \n[83] When these conditions are met, the court is able to rely on the sufficiently \nprecise time contemplated by the parties for the occurrence of the event that they \nconsidered certain, and to fix the term on the day on which the event considered cert ain \nshould have occurred.  \n(iii) Articles 1512 and 1510 C.C.Q.  Are Mutually Exclusive  \n[84] It is apparent from the discussion of the principles in arts.  1512 and 1510 \nC.C.Q.  that, while both of these provisions are concerned with situations involving \nterms whose date of occurrence is undetermined, the respective conditions for their \napplication differ in two respects. First, art.  1510 C.C.Q.  requires that the day on which \nthe event should have occurred be determinable, whereas this is not the case for the \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n term contempl ated by art.  1512 C.C.Q.  Second, art.  1510 C.C.Q.  requires that the \noccurrence of the event considered certain have become impossible, while art.  1512 \nC.C.Q.  is based on the premise that, even though the parties decided on the term by \nreference to an event  that was considered certain, they did not specify the day on which \nthe term would expire (Karim, at Nos.  363-66; Baudouin, Jobin and Vézina, at No.  565; \nMarchisio, at pp.  268-69). For these reasons, arts.  1512 and 1510 are mutually \nexclusive.  \n(3) Application of the Principles Outlined  \n(a) The City’s Obligation Is an Obligation With a Suspensive Term, Not a \nConditional Obligation  \n[85] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in focusing solely \non the objectively  uncertain nature of future cadastral op erations by Larochelle or its \nsubsidiaries in order to characterize the City’s obligation.

    "text": " City’s Obligation Is an Obligation With a Suspensive Term, Not a \nConditional Obligation  \n[85] I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in focusing solely \non the objectively  uncertain nature of future cadastral op erations by Larochelle or its \nsubsidiaries in order to characterize the City’s obligation. Indeed, to properly \ndistinguish an obligation with a term from a conditional obligation in this case, it was \nimportant to consider the occurrence of the event in a s ubjective sense as well. More \nspecifically, the question overlooked by the trial judge was whether, in the parties’ \nminds, future cadastral operations were certain.  \n[86] In my view, the circumstances in which the agreement was entered into \nrather show that the parties intended to make the exigibility of the City’s obligation, \nthat is, effecting compensation for the credited area of land making up the bank, \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n dependent on future cadastral operations. This finding therefore weighs in favour of the \nexistence of an ob ligation with a suspensive term.  \n[87] Before the agreement was entered into, Larochelle was in fact seeking \ncompensation from the City for the excess land transferred. It defies belief that \nLarochelle would have renounced this and replaced it with a conditional  claim. \nLarochelle asked to be reimbursed by the City, which said that it was unable to pay, \nand it was in this context that the parties reached a compromise: the creation of a land \nbank that included this “excess transfer” and that would be used when Laro chelle or \none of its subsidiaries made new applications for approval of a cadastral operation. In \naddition, the evidence indicates that the parties intended to continue the development \nof land and firmly believed that this was achievable. At the time they entered into the \nagreement, the parties were convinced that future real estate development projects \nwould take place, including the one in the Du Moulin sector, which would allow some \nof the credits in the bank to be used. With respect to that development project, the bank \nwas seen as a mere [ TRANSLATION ] “formality” for the “continuation of the \ndevelopment of Sainte -Julie that was going into [the Du Moulin] sector” (A.R., vol.  V, \nat p. 178; A.R., vol.  VI, at pp.  14-15). On the one hand, Larochelle was hopi ng at the \ntime for dezoning in the short term so that it could use the bank (A.R., vol.  VI, at p.  84). \nOn the other, the City had high hopes that Larochelle would pursue new developments.  \n[88] Thus, the two parties had a common vision regarding future real esta te \ndevelopments on the City’s territory and, by extension, regarding an impending use of \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n the “area bank”. The events envisioned by the parties were therefore certain, which \nweighs in favour of an obligation with a suspensive term. The trial judge according ly \nerred in characterizing the obligation as conditional.  \n(b) The Term of the City’s Obligation Consists of New Cadastral Operations, \nEven if the Times at Which They Are to Occur Are Not Determined  \n[89] Before I set about fixing the term under art.  1512 C.C.Q. , it is important to \nnote, with respect, and as the Court of Appeal also noted, that the trial judge made a \npalpable and overriding error in her alternative determination by implicitly defining the \nterm as being limited to the cadastral operation that would res ult from the dezoning of \nthe Du Moulin sector.  \n[90] In fact, if she had decided that the City’s obligation was suspended until \nthe expiry of a term, the trial judge would have fixed that term in 2012, after the failure \nof the applications for exclusion from the  agricultural zone and the adoption of the \nMLUDP by the metropolitan regional community, thereby making the City’s \nobligation exigible on that date. In these circumstances, the trial judge would have \nconcluded that the action was prescribed.  \n[91] I agree with t he Court of Appeal that there is a palpable and overriding \nerror in that conclusion, because it rests on the premise that the “area bank” could be \nused only in relation to the agricultural zone land owned by Laroda in the Du Moulin \nsector.

I will explain.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n [92] In her analysis of the conditional obligation a few paragraphs before her \nanalysis of the obligation with a term, the trial judge found that the bank could have \nbeen used following the dezoning of the Du Moulin sector or through the acquisition \nof land in a residential zone (para.  56). It is difficult to understand why, in her \nalternative analysis of the obligation with a term, the trial judge did not take this \npossibility into account. This error — a palpable one, in my opinion — is overriding as \nwell beca use it led to the term being fixed in 2012 rather than 2015 and also led to an \nalternative conclusion that the action was prescribed.  \n[93] In this case, the uncontradicted evidence is to the effect that the area in the \nbank was not meant to be used solely for t he Du Moulin sector, and the term therefore \ncannot be limited to just one future cadastral operation following the dezoning of this \nsector.  \n[94] Indeed, the parties’ agreement in no way stipulates that a portion of the \narea in the bank must be used in connectio n with a specific parcel of land and therefore \nthat the term is related to a cadastral operation in the Du Moulin sector. On the contrary, \nthe resolution of the City’s municipal council, which is an integral part of the \nagreement, states that “this agreeme nt will create a bank for the purposes of parks or \nplaygrounds for future approvals of cadastral operations ” (A.R., vol.  II, at p.  138 \n(emphasis added); see also Sup.  Ct. reasons, at para.  37), without the times at which \nthose operations would occur being specified.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n [95] Moreover, since the bank’s value was not linked to any particular parcel of \nland, but rather to an  area, it could be used in its entirety for land other than that in the \nDu Moulin sector, provided that the land was on the City’s territory. In th is regard, \narticle 5 of the agreement provides that Larochelle “has created a bank of 26,705.78 \nsquare metres” (A.R., vol.  II, at p.  137).  \n[96] Furthermore, in addition to the content of the agreement, there is much \nother evidence showing that the area in the b ank was not meant to be applied only to \nthe Du  Moulin sector. It may be noted, in particular, that the area of this land alone, \nand the value of the transfer for parks, playgrounds and green spaces that was to result \nfrom it pursuant to the municipal by -law, were not enough to exhaust the bank. In fact, \ngiven the area of this land, only 14,300  m2 of the 26,705.78  m2 making up the bank \nwould have been used by the end of this cadastral operation.  \n[97] Lastly, neither of the two parties believes that the term was l inked solely to \nthe dezoning of the Du  Moulin sector. The City acknowledges that, if the obligation is \none with a term, the event relating to this term is the occurrence of [ TRANSLATION ] \n“new cadastral operations” (A.F., at para.  141). As for Laroda, its view is that the event \nis the development of a new parcel of land (R.F., at para.  128), which involves cadastral \noperations (A.R., vol.  VI, at p.  5). \n[98] As the Court of Appeal correctly noted, the bank could be used for \ncompensation purposes in the context of  transfers for parks, playgrounds and green \nspaces related to future development projects, on the basis of one of the following three \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n scenarios: (1)  on a parcel of land owned by one of the companies in the Larochelle \ngroup, subject to first obtaining an ex clusion from the agricultural zone from the \nCPTAQ; (2",

IX, at \npp. 85-87). In addition, the City and Laroda submitted a new project in 2016 in order \nto obtain an exclusion from the agricultural zone, which suggests that this option \nremained possible.  \n[101]  With regard to the option of acquiring an immovable in the white zone, \nMr. Larochelle acknowledged in his pre -trial examination that white -zoned land owned \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n by a certain Mr.  Trudeau near autoroute 20 could still be developed (A.R., vol.  V, at \npp. 76-77). \n[102]  Next, with regard to the option of a transfer to Laroda of a parcel  of land \nacquired by the City through expropriation, an employee of the City stated that, if this \nhad been attempted, it was not impossible that the municipal council would expropriate \nMr. Trudeau’s land (A.R., vol.  X, at p.  87). There was nothing far -fetched about s uch \nan expropriation given that, as the City’s employee acknowledged, the \nnon-development of that land hindered the extension of the City’s urban territory and \nthere was no timetable in place for developing it (A.R., vol.  IX, at pp.  71-73; A.R.,  \nvol. X, at pp.  86-87). \n[103]  In short, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in her \nalternative determination by finding that the term is related solely to the Du Moulin \nsector, that it should be fixed in 2012 and that the action was prescribed.  \n(c) Under Article 1512 C.C.Q., the Term Is Fixed on the Date of the Demand \nLetter, December  15, 2015  \n[104]  It is therefore art.  1512 C.C.Q.  that must apply in this case, and I am of the \nview that the term must be fixed at the time of the demand letter, that is, at \nDecember  15, 2015.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n [105]  It is important at the outset to exclude the application of the second \nparagraph of art.  1512 C.C.Q. , given that the parties had agreed on a term. Indeed, the \nagreement specified a term based on events that were considered certain but who se \ntime of occurrence was undetermined: the future cadastral operations.  \n[106]  Moreover, I note that the first paragraph’s conditions for fixing the term \nare met. First, in its originating application, Laroda asked the court to fix the term under \nart. 1512 C.C.Q . (A.R., vol.  II, at p.  7). Next, the parties did not fix the date on which \nthe term",

The \n“bank” contract in this case, in a similar fashion to a [ TRANSLATION ] “when able to do \nso” paym ent clause ( Commentaires du ministre de la Justice , at p.  929 (emphasis in \noriginal); Levesque, at paras.  298-99), cannot be performed until land is available to \neffect compensation. However, the term was potestative, insofar  as the occurrence of \nthe event  that was considered certain depended on the parties’ conduct ; they had to take \naction in order for new cadastral operations to occur. Article 1512 C.C.Q.  therefore \napplies. Lastly, the parties did not, after a reasonable time, establish when the term \nwoul d occur. Fourteen years elapsed between the signing of the agreement and the \ndemand letter, and no cadastral operation took place despite the parties’ sustained \nefforts.  \n[107]  This Court must now fix the term according to the nature of the obligation, \nthe situat ion of the parties and any appropriate circumstances. In my view, the term \nmust be fixed at the time of the demand letter, that is, at December  15, 2015. Until that \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n date, the parties, and Laroda in particular, took their principal steps and made a great \neffort to use the “area bank”. As Laroda stated in its demand letter, the situation had \ngone on long enough by that date and had to be brought to an end. The jurisprudence \nallows for the possibility of fixing the term at the time of the demand letter, especi ally \nwhere, as here, it is the creditor — which complied with all of its obligations under the \nagreement by transferring a total area of 26,705.78  m2 — that has the right to fix the \nterm (Marchisio, at pp.  264-65; Ratelle v. Chevrette , 2014 QCCA 2070, at p ara. 4; \nSofilco inc. v. 9056 -8544 Québec inc. , 2012 QCCS 2191, at paras.  88-91). \n[108]  Pursuant to art.  1512 C.C.Q. , I therefore fix the term at December  15, 2015. \nFurthermore, Laroda’s action is not prescribed, because it instituted its proceedings on \nDecember  13, 2018.  \nC. To What Remedy Is the Respondent Entitled?  \n[109]  The question of the remedy to which Laroda is entitled must now be \nconsidered. On this point, the parties take issue with the fact that the Court of Appeal \napplied the restitution of prestations regime t o establish the remedy to which the \nrespondent is entitled. They argue that, contrary to what the Court of Appeal stated, the \nrestitution of prestations regime was no longer applicable after the agreement was \nsigned. Laroda therefore submits that it is the  performance by equivalence regime that \napplies in this case, which the City concedes, to the extent that the respondent is entitled \nto such performance.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n [110]  It is true that the “excess transfer” of 3,898.27  m2 was a debt owed by the \nCity. Pursuant to art.  1492 C.C.Q. , initially this “excess transfer” by Larochelle — only \nthis “excess transfer” and not the area of 22,807.5  m2 — had to be returned by the City \nto Larochelle under the rules on restitution of prestations. However, since I have \nalready found that th e debt for the “excess transfer” of 3,898.27  m² was extinguished \nand that novation was effected, I am of the view that the circumstances of this case are \nnot such as to make the restitution of prestations regime in arts.  1699 et seq.",

However, since I have \nalready found that th e debt for the “excess transfer” of 3,898.27  m² was extinguished \nand that novation was effected, I am of the view that the circumstances of this case are \nnot such as to make the restitution of prestations regime in arts.  1699 et seq. C.C.Q.  \napplicable.  \n[111]  Restitution of prestations takes place “where a person is bound by law  to \nreturn to another person the property he has received, either without right or in error” \nor in other situations (art.  1699 para.  1 C.C.Q. ). In Montréal (City) v. Octane Stratégie \ninc., 2019 SCC 57, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 138, m y colleague Brown  J. and I, dissenting, but \nnot on this point, described the three scenarios in which this regime applies : \n . . . (1) where a person has received property “without right or in error” (for \nexample, the receipt of a payment not due: arts.  1554, 1491 and 1492 \nC.C.Q. ), (2)  where a person has received property “under a juridical act \nwhich is subsequently annulled wit h retroactive effect” (for example, the \nannulment of a contract: art.  1422 C.C.Q. ), and (3)  where a person has \nreceived property under a juridical act but the person’s “obligations \nbecome impossible to perform by reason of superior force” \n(J.-L. Baudouin a nd P. -G. Jobin, Les obligations  (7th ed. 2013), by \nP.-G. Jobin and N.  Vézina, at No.  920; D.  Lluelles and B.  Moore, Droit \ndes obligations  (3rd ed. 2018), at No.  1227). [para.  102] \n[112]  In the case at bar, none of these scenarios applies. The City is not bound t o \nreturn to Laroda “ the property [it] has received, either without right or in error” , no \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n party is seeking to have the 2001 agreement annulled, and the City’s obligation did not \nbecome impossible to perform by reason of superior force (art.  1699 para.  1 C.C.Q. ). \n[113]  Accordingly, it cannot be asserted, as the Court of Appeal did, that the City \ncontinued to have an obligation to return the excess area received to Larochelle. It is \nerroneous to say that the bank of 26,705.78  m² was “received in excess” by the City , as \nit instead represents the consideration agreed upon in the agreement, in settlement of \nthe “excess transfer” and the financing of an additional parcel of land.  \n[114]  In this context, it is appropriate to turn to the performance by equivalence \nregime set out  in arts.  1607 et seq. C.C.Q. , which establishes the relevant rules for \ndetermining the remedy to which the respondent is entitled in this case.  \n[115]  The City’s obligation with a term became exigible on December  15, 2015. \nThe parties concede that specific perfo rmance is impossible because of the \ncircumstances that exist today. The fact is that a portion of the transferred land is being \nused for public purposes. It is therefore a circumstantial impossibility for the City to \nmake specific performance of its obliga tion and not an absolute impossibility, since the \nagreement could theoretically still be carried out (through the development of a parcel \nof land acquired by Laroda in the white zone, a parcel of land transferred to Laroda by \nthe City or a dezoned parcel o f land already owned by Laroda).  \n[116]  The agreement does not set out any applicable mechanism in the event that \nthe bank becomes impossible to use. I also recognize that it does not state that the City \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n will reimburse the value of the land in question to Laroche lle.

I also recognize that it does not state that the City \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n will reimburse the value of the land in question to Laroche lle. That being said, the fact \nremains that the parties agreed that the City would compensate Larochelle for the value \nof the transferred land using a specific mechanism provided for in the agreement. It is \nimportant to note that the parties never contempl ated or intended that the transfers \nwould be gratuitous. Moreover, the City was able to use the land — and even sold part \nof it in 2010 — for the construction of a childcare centre.  \n[117]  I refer again here to the letter of December  15, 2015, from Larochelle to \nthe City (A.R., vol.  III, at pp.  134-36), which the Superior Court judge described as \n[TRANSLATION ] “clearly attest[ing] to the parties’ state of mind at the time the \nAgreement was negotiated and entered into” (para.  55). In that letter, Larochelle states \nthat when the bank was created, the parties anticipated that part of it would be used for \ndevelopment in the Du Moulin sector and that [ TRANSLATION ] “[t]he balance could \nhave been paid either in money by the city or through the transfer of land” (A.R., \nvol. III, at p.  135). This is one more element showing that the parties intended to \ncompletely exclude the restitution of prestations regime.  \n[118]  Where specific performance of an obligation is impossible, an alternative \nmode of performance is made available by Qu ebec civil law, namely performance by \nequivalence. This is provided for in arts.  1607 et seq. C.C.Q. , which give the creditor \nthe right to obtain damages for injury caused by the debtor’s failure to comply with its \nobligation. Article 1611 para.  1 C.C.Q. , for its part, provides that “[t] he damages due \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n to the creditor compensate for the amount of the loss he has sustained and the profit of \nwhich he has been deprived ”. \n[119]  In this case, the injury sustained by Laroda lies in being deprived of the \nvalue of the lan d transferred to the City, land that the City used without having to pay \na single cent to acquire it. Specifically, if Larochelle had not transferred the area of \n3,898.27  m2 and the area of 45,615  m2 to the City, it could have freely disposed of them \nand r eceived their value, whether by sale or otherwise. The loss of this possibility \njustifies monetary compensation equivalent to the value of the land.  \n[120]  However, the parties disagree on the determination of this value. The Court \nof Appeal, applying the legal m echanism of restitution by equivalence, stated that the \nCity has an obligation to make restitution by equivalence for 26,705.78  m2 based on \nthe value on the property assessment roll for 2001, set at $1.00 per square foot, for a \ntotal of $287,458.51 in comp ensation (paras.  58-63). According to Laroda, on top of \nthe error regarding the choice of regime and the area for which restitution is to be made \n(26,705.78  m2 rather than 3,898.27  m2 + 45,615  m2, for a total of 49,513.27  m2), the \nvalue should correspond t o the fair market value of the land on the date on which the \nproceedings were heard by the Superior Court in 2021. As for the City, it submits that \nif compensation is to be awarded to Laroda, the applicable value must be that listed on \nthe property assessm ent roll in force in 2001, at the time the agreement was entered \ninto. \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n [121]  In my view, the value of the compensation must correspond to the fair \nmarket value of the land making up the bank at the time the obligation became exigible, \nthat is, on the date of the  demand letter of December  15, 2015.

With all due respect to \nthe Court of Appeal, there is no reason to rely on the value on the property assessment \nroll for 2001 rather than the market value of the land in this case. It is important to note \nthat the fact the land transferred by Larochelle in 2001 was likely to increase in value \nover time was a key incentive for Larochelle to enter into the agreement for the creation \nof the “area bank” with the City. Moreover, when the City, in 2010, sold a parcel of \nland t hat it had initially received from Larochelle to a childcare centre for the purposes \nof a park, it did so on the basis of the fair market value, not the value listed on the \nproperty assessment roll in 2001.  \n[122]  That being said, the evidence in the record does not enable our Court to \ndetermine the market value, as of December  15, 2015, of an area of 26,705.78  m2 of \nbulk land free of park fees on the territory of Ville de Sainte -Julie. Laroda filed expert \nvaluation evidence in the record concerning the market val ue of such a bank at the time \nthe proceedings were instituted on December  13, 2018, with an update to February  19, \n2021. The City did not file any counter -valuation and relies on the value of the land \ntransferred by Laroda as listed on the property assessm ent roll for 2001.  \n[123]  The case should therefore be remanded to the Superior Court so that a \nfinding can be made on a single question, namely the market value, as of December  15, \n2015, of an area of 26,705.78  m2 of bulk land free of park fees on the territory of Ville \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n de Sainte -Julie ( Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.

Conclusion  \n[124]  For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal; allow the cross -appeal in \npart; set aside the judgments of the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Quebec Superior \nCourt; declare that the City’s obligation is one with a suspensive term; fix the term at \nDecember  15, 2015; order the City to pay Laroda the market value as of December  15, \n2015, of the area of 26,705.78  m2 of bulk land free of park fees on the territory of Ville \nde Sainte -Julie provided for by the agreement; and remand the case to the Superior \nCourt solely on the question of determining this market value as of December  15, 2015, \nwith costs to Laroda throughout, including expert fees.  \n  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n APPENDIX A  \nFull Text of the Agreement Entered Into by the Parties  \n[TRANSLATION ] \nAGREEMENT entered into at Sainte -Julie this 19th day of the month of \nFebruary two thousand and one (2001).  \nBETWEEN:   PROMOTIONS M.G.

A payment made in error, or merely to avoid injury to the person making it while \nprotesting that he owes nothing, obliges the person who receives it to make restitution.  \n However, a person who receives the payment in good faith is not obliged to make \nrestitution where, in consequence of the payment, the person’s claim is prescribed or the \nperson has destroyed his title or relinquished a security, saving the remedy of the person \nhaving made the payment against the true debtor.  \n1492.

An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain \nevent, either by suspending it until the event occurs or is certain not  to occur, or by \nmaking its extinction dependent on whether or not the event occurs.  \n1508. An obligation with a suspensive term is an existing obligation that does not become \nexigible until the occurrence of a future and certain event.  \n1510.

The creditor is entitled to damages for bodily, moral or material injury which is an \nimmediate and direct consequence of the debtor’s default.  \n1611.  The damages due to the creditor compensate for the amount of the loss he has \nsustained and the  profit of which he has been deprived.  \n Future injury which is certain and assessable is taken into account in awarding \ndamages.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n 1660.  Novation is effected where the debtor contracts towards his creditor a new debt \nwhich is substituted for the former debt,  which is extinguished, or where a new debtor is \nsubstituted for the former debtor, who is discharged by the creditor; in such a case, \nnovation may be effected without the consent of the former debtor.  \n Novation is also effected where, by the effect of a n ew contract, a new creditor \nis substituted for the former creditor, towards whom the debtor is discharged.  \n1661.  Novation is not presumed; the intention to effect it must be evident  \n1662.  Hypothecs attached to the former claim are not transferred to the cl aim substituted \nfor it, unless they are expressly reserved by the creditor.  \n1663.  Where novation is effected by substitution of a new debtor, the new debtor may \nnot set up against the creditor the defenses which he could have raised against the former \ndebtor, nor the defenses which the former debtor had against the creditor, unless, in the \nlatter case, he may invoke the nullity of the act that bound them.  \n Furthermore, hypothecs attached to the former claim may not be transferred to \nthe property of the new debtor; nor may they be reserved upon the property of the former \ndebtor without his consent. However, they may be transferred to property acquired from \nthe former debtor by the new debtor, if the new debtor consents thereto.  \n1664.  Where novation is effecte d between the creditor and one of the solidary debtors, \nhypothecs attached to the former claim may only be reserved upon the property of the \nco-debtor who contracts the new debt.  \n1665.  Novation effected between the creditor and one of the solidary debtors releases the \nother co -debtors with respect to the creditor; novation effected with respect to the \nprincipal debtor releases the sureties.  \n However, where the creditor has required the accession of the co -debtors, in the \nfirst case, or of the sureties, in t he second case, the creditor’s former claim subsists if the \nco-debtors or the sureties refuse to accede to the new contract.  \n1666.  Novation which has been agreed to by one of the solidary creditors may not be set \nup against the other co -creditors, except f or his share in the solidary claim.  \n1699.  Restitution of prestations takes place where a person is bound by law to return to \nanother person the property he has received, either without right or in error, or under a \njuridical act which is subsequently annul led with retroactive effect or whose obligations \nbecome impossible to perform by reason of superior force.  \n The court may, exceptionally, refuse restitution where it would have the effect of \naccording an undue advantage to one party, whether the debtor or the creditor, unless it \nconsiders it sufficient, in that case, to modify the scope or modalities of the restitution \ninstead.  \n2025 SCC 44 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n  \n Appeal  dismissed  and cross -appeal allowed in part , with costs throughout . \n Solicitors for the appellant/r espondent on cross -appeal:  Poupart & \n",
