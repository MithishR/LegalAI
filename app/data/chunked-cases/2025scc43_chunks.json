C-46, s.  495(2), (3).  \n The accused was arrested without  warrant 11 days after committing,  \naccording to the allegations in the indictment, sexual assault . At the police station, he \nwas subjected to an interrogation that was recorded on video, during which he made an \nincriminating statement . Before his trial beg an, the accused filed a motion asking the \ncourt to exclude the incriminating statement on the ground that his arrest without \nwarrant was unlawful and therefore arbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of the \nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . According t o him, the arrest without \nwarrant was contrary to s.  495(2) of the Criminal Code  because the police did not \nbelieve on reasonable grounds that the arrest was necessary to satisfy the public interest \nand because there was no risk that he would fail to atten d for his appearance.  \n The trial judge refused to hold a voir dire  to determine the lawfulness of \nthe arrest under s.  495(2). He found that an arrest without warrant that is contrary to \ns. 495(2) is nonetheless lawful through the application of s.  495(3) a s long as the peace \nofficer acts in compliance with s.  495(1) (a). Since the peace officers had believed on \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n reasonable grounds that an offence had been committed within the meaning of \ns. 495(1) (a), the judge was of the view that the accused’s motion had no chance of \nsuccess. The incriminating statement was not excluded, and the accused was convicted. \nOn appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal found that",

    "text": "495(1) (a). Since the peace officers had believed on \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n reasonable grounds that an offence had been committed within the meaning of \ns. 495(1) (a), the judge was of the view that the accused’s motion had no chance of \nsuccess. The incriminating statement was not excluded, and the accused was convicted. \nOn appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal found that the interpretation of s.  495(2) \nand (3) adopted by the trial judge was incorrect. In its opinion, there  were valid grounds \nfor the request for a voir dire , since s.  495(3) provides an opportunity to challenge the \nlawfulness of an arrest without warrant and since there was no apparent basis on which \nto conclude that s.  495(2) justified the accused’s arrest. The Court of Appeal ordered a \nnew trial.  \n Held : The appeal should be dismissed.  \n In a criminal proceeding, a judge can grant a motion under s.  9 of the \nCharter  alleging the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of an arrest without warrant that \ndoes not meet the requirements of s.  495(2) . Properly interpreted, s.  495(2) can have \nthe effect of making an arrest unlawful under s.  9 of the Charter , and s.  495(3) does \nnot preclude an accused from alleging such an infringement of s.  9 of the Charter and \nseeking a remedy  under s.  24 of the Charter  in the accused’s own trial. In this case, the \nrefusal to hold a voir dire  on the question of the lawfulness of the accused’s arrest is a \nreviewable error that warrants a new trial.  The case does not involve any of the \nscenarios in which s.  495(3) applies, and the criminal or civil liability of the peace \nofficer who arrested the accused without warrant is not in issue. The presumption of \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n lawfulness created by s.  495(3) does not apply, and the trial court had to hold a voir \ndire to determine the lawfulness of the arrest.  \n It is necessary to use the modern approach to statutory interpretation  to \ndetermine the proper interpretation to be given to s.  495(2) and (3). The statutory \ninterpretation exercise is focused on the intent of the legislature at the time of \nenactment, and courts are bound to give effect to that intent.  The text of a provision is \nthe anchor of the interpretative exercise , and this approach  requires that the meaning of \nthe provisions be ascertained in light of their t ext, their context and their purpose.  \n First of all, s.  495(1) of the Criminal Code  states the grounds required for \nan arrest  without warrant and remains the foundation of this discretion. It provides that \na peace officer “may arrest without warrant .  . . a person” if the officer believes on \nreasonable grounds that an indictable offence has been or is about to be committed, if \nthe officer finds the person committing a criminal offence or if the officer has \nreasonable grounds to believe that there is a warra nt for the person’s arrest or \ncommittal. The use of the expression “may arrest without warrant” indicates that \ns. 495(1) is permissive, but the power so conferred is not absolute.  This power was the \nsubject of a major reform aimed at limiting the use of ar rest and avoiding unnecessary \npre-trial arrest and detention , in which Parliament enacted the provisions that are now \ns. 495(2) and s.  495(3) . In enacting these two provisions, Parliament sought to reduce \nunnecessary arrests without warrant  and to protect  a peace officer who made an arrest \nwithout warrant if, in good faith, the officer made a mistake in judgment . Parliament’s \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n intention was to balance various considerations, including individual freedoms, public \nsafety and the public interest in ensuring th at peace officers can do their work \neffectively . \n Section 495(2) qualifies the general rule set out in s.  495(1): it imposes \nbinding norms that limit the discretion of peace officers, which at one time was very \nbroad, to make an arrest without warrant when  certain cumulative conditions are met . \nThe scope of s.  495(2) is limited, since it applies only to hybrid offences, offences \npunishable on",

    "text": " th at peace officers can do their work \neffectively . \n Section 495(2) qualifies the general rule set out in s.  495(1): it imposes \nbinding norms that limit the discretion of peace officers, which at one time was very \nbroad, to make an arrest without warrant when  certain cumulative conditions are met . \nThe scope of s.  495(2) is limited, since it applies only to hybrid offences, offences \npunishable on summary conviction and the indictable offences mentioned in s.  553 of \nthe Criminal Code  (s. 495(2)(a) to (c)). In ad dition, the limitation in s.  495(2) applies \nonly when two requirements are met : first, the peace officer must believe on reasonable \ngrounds that the public interest may be satisfied without making an arrest without \nwarrant (s.  495(2)(d)); and second, the p eace officer must have no reasonable grounds \nto believe that, if he or she does not arrest the person without warrant, the person will \nfail to attend court (s.  495(2)(e)).  \n The text, context and purpose of s.  495(2) of the Criminal Code  lead to the \nconclus ion that the limitations imposed on the power of arrest without warrant are \nmandatory in nature: when the conditions set out in para.  (d), para.  (e) and any of \nparas.  (a) to (c) are met, an arrest without warrant is strictly prohibited . Section  495(2) \nstates that a peace officer “shall not” arrest a person without warrant where the \nrequirements mentioned are met . According to the rule of interpretation codified in \ns. 11 of the Interpretation Act , the word “shall” in the expression “shall not” should be \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n construed as expressing an obligation . Peace officers therefore have an obligation to \nassess whether an arrest without warrant is justified in the public interest and whether \nthere is a risk that the accused will not appear.  Peace officers contravene s.  495(2)  \nwhere they fail to assess these criteria before acting or where they — wrongly — make \nan arrest without warrant when the conditions do not permit them to do so . An arrest \ncontrary to s.  495(2) is an unlawful arrest, which suffices to characterize it as ar bitrary \nwithin the meaning of s.  9 of the Charter . \n Section 495(3)  provides provide peace officers and any person responsible \nfor them with some protection against proceedings in which they face criminal or civil \nliability for an arrest contrary to s.  495(2). Section 495(3) creates a presumption of \nlawfulness with respect to the conduct of a peace officer who has made an arrest \nwithout warrant that does not meet the requirements of s.  495(2), as long as the officer \nacted in compliance with s.  495(1). Sectio n 495(3)(a) prevents, for example, a peace \nofficer from being held criminally liable for an offence under the Criminal Code  for \nhaving breached the requirements of s.  495(2) . However, s.  495(3)(b) allows a person \nwho has been arrested  to rebut this presump tion in a proceeding not brought under the \nCriminal Code  or any other Act of Parliament . Section 495(3)(b) therefore allows such \na person  to bring a civil suit against the peace officer, or the officer’s employer, but the \nperson arrested without warrant be ars the burden of proving that the peace officer \nbelieved on reasonable grounds that the public interest could be satisfied without \narresting the person and that there was no risk of the person failing to attend court . \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n  The presumption of lawfulness create d by s.  495(3) does not apply  when \nthe criminal or civil liability of the officer or of any person responsible for the officer \nis not in issue . Under s.  495(3)(a) and (b), the proceedings must be directly aimed at \nthe conduct of the peace officer who made the arrest without warrant contrary to the \nrequirements of s . 495(2). A n interpretation whereby an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) \nwould still be considered lawful in the criminal trial of the person who was arrested \nwould diminish the deterrent effect of s.  495(2) , one of the objectives of which is",

The wording of \nthe provisions  on the power of arrest without warrant came into force nearly a decade \nbefore the enactment of the Charter . Parliament could not have imagined at the time \nthat, years later, accused persons would be able, in their own criminal trial, to challenge \ninfringe ments of their constitutional rights by asserting the unlawfulness of their arrest. \nThe Charter  had not yet been enacted, and the Court had not recognized that an \nunlawful arrest could amount to an arbitrary arrest. Nor could Parliament have \nanticipated th at accused persons would be able to seek remedies under the  Charter . The \nwording of s.  495(3) must be interpreted in light of this reality.  \nCases Cited  \n Overruled: R. v. Adams  (1972), 21 C.R.N.S. 257;  R. v. McKibbon (1973), \n12 C.C.C. (2d) 66;  R. v.

Application to the Facts  [140]  \nV. Conclusion  [147]  \nI. Overview  \n[1] This appeal concerns the interpretation of s.  495(2 ) and s.  495(3) of the \nCriminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.  C-46 (“ Cr. C.”), which govern the power of peace \nofficers under s.  495(1) Cr. C. to make arrests without warrant. The question is \nwhether, in a criminal proceeding, a judge can grant a motion under s.  9 of the \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  alleging the unlawfulness and arbitrariness \nof an arrest without warrant that does not meet the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. \n[2] It must be acknowledged that s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) Cr. C. are not drafted \nin the clearest manner. The proof of this is that courts across the country disagree on \nthe interpretation to be given to them. To decide this appeal, I rely on the modern \napproach to statutory interpretation, which requires that the meani ng of these \nprovisions be ascertained in light of their text, their context and their purpose.  \n[3] First, I interpret s.  495(2) Cr. C. to determine whether it imposes binding \nlimitations on the power of a peace officer who arrests a person without warrant, suc h \nthat an arrest that is not in compliance with this provision becomes unlawful. My \nanalysis leads to the conclusion that this provision is binding and mandatory. In other \nwords, an arrest that is contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. is unlawful under the Criminal  Code . \nThis provision is not merely a guideline, a practice guide or a suggestion from \nParliament. On the contrary, it obliges a peace officer not to arrest a person without \nwarrant when all of the requirements set out in s.  495(2) Cr. C. are met.  \n[4] Second, I interpret s.  495(3) Cr. C. to determine whether its effect is to \ndeprive an accused of the opportunity to allege an infringement of s.  9 of the Charter  \nand to obtain a remedy under s.",

    "text": " On the contrary, it obliges a peace officer not to arrest a person without \nwarrant when all of the requirements set out in s.  495(2) Cr. C. are met.  \n[4] Second, I interpret s.  495(3) Cr. C. to determine whether its effect is to \ndeprive an accused of the opportunity to allege an infringement of s.  9 of the Charter  \nand to obtain a remedy under s.  24 in a criminal proceeding relating to the accused’s \nown criminal lia bility. My analysis leads me to conclude that this provision applies in \nvery specific cases, namely where a proceeding specifically concerns the liability of \nthe peace officer who made an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. and of any person \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n responsible fo r that peace officer.  On the one hand, s.  495(3 )(a) Cr. C. applies where \nthe proceeding is brought under the Criminal Code  or any other Act of Parliament and \nconcerns the criminal liability of the peace officer or of persons responsible for that \nofficer . On the other, s.  495(3) (b) Cr. C. applies where the proceeding is brought under \na statute that is not the Criminal Code  or another Act of Parliament. This includes a \ncivil proceeding that concerns the civil liability of the peace officer who made the arrest  \ncontrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. or of persons responsible for that officer.  \n[5] In sum, the common feature of s.  495(3) (a) and (b) Cr. C. is that the \nproceeding must necessarily relate to the criminal or civil conduct of a peace officer \nwhere there has been a co ntravention of s.  495(2) Cr. C. This therefore means, for the \npurposes of this appeal, that s.  495(3) Cr. C. is not applicable, since this appeal \nconcerns a criminal proceeding relating to the criminal liability of the person arrested \nwithout warrant. Sect ion 495(3)(a) Cr. C. thus does  not nullify from the outset the \nchances of success of a person arrested without warrant who would like to challenge \nthe lawfulness of his or her arrest through a voir dire  based on s.  9 of the Charter . \n[6] Section 495(2) Cr. C. is mandatory in nature and allows an accused to raise, \nunder s.  9 of the Charter in the context of a voir dire , the unlawfulness and arbitrariness \nof an arrest that does not comply with this provision. Moreover, s.  495(3) Cr. C., \nproperly interpreted, canno t serve in this case to immunize an arrest contrary to \ns. 495(2) Cr. C., since the proceeding does not relate to the criminal liability of a peace \nofficer or of persons responsible for that officer . \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n \n [7] The trial judge was required in this case to hold a voir dire to determine the \nlawfulness of the respondent’s arrest without warrant. The respondent’s motion was \nnot manifestly frivolous, contrary to what was decided. The failure to hold a voir dire  \nis a reviewable error of law that warrants a new trial.  \n[8] I would  therefore dismiss the appeal and uphold the order for a new trial \nmade by the Quebec Court of Appeal.  \nII. Background  \n Facts  \n[9] On or about March 8, 2018, the respondent, David Carignan, allegedly \ncommitted acts of a sexual nature that, according to the allegations in the indictment, \nsatisfy the constituent elements of the offence of sexual assault under s.  271(a) Cr. C. \n[10] Eleven days later, on March 20, 2018, he was arrested without warrant \ninside his educational institution for the acts alleged against hi m. \n[11] Following his arrest, peace officers took the respondent to the police \nstation, where he was subjected to an interrogation that was recorded on video. During \nthat interrogation, the respondent made an incriminating statement.  \n Judicial History  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n (1) Court of Q uébec (Judge Roy)  \n[12] In November 2018, before his trial began, the respondent filed a motion \nfor exclusion of evidence and for a stay of proceedings based on ss.  7,",

    "text": ", where he was subjected to an interrogation that was recorded on video. During \nthat interrogation, the respondent made an incriminating statement.  \n Judicial History  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n (1) Court of Q uébec (Judge Roy)  \n[12] In November 2018, before his trial began, the respondent filed a motion \nfor exclusion of evidence and for a stay of proceedings based on ss.  7, 9 and 24 of the \nCharter . The respondent asked the court to exclude the incriminating statement  \nrecorded on video on the ground that his arrest on March 20, 2018, was unlawful and \ntherefore arbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of the Charter . According to him, the \narrest without warrant was contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. because the police did not \nbelieve on reasonable grounds that the arrest was necessary to satisfy the public interest \nand because there was no risk that he would fail to attend court for his appearance.  \n[13] When the trial began, the trial judge dismissed the respondent’s motion for \nexclusi on of evidence, thereby refusing to hold a voir dire  to determine the lawfulness \nof the arrest under s.  495(2) Cr. C. The judge based his reasoning on an interpretation \nwhereby an arrest without warrant that is contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. is nonetheless \nlawful through the application of s.  495(3) Cr. C. as long as the peace officer acts in \ncompliance with s.  495(1) (a) Cr. C. Since the peace officers had believed on reasonable \ngrounds that an indictable offence had been committed within the  meaning of \ns. 495(1) (a) Cr. C., the judge was of the view that the respondent’s motion had no \nchance of success. The incriminating statement was therefore part of the evidence \nadduced by the Crown at the trial that followed.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n [14] At the conclusion of the trial , the judge convicted the respondent, relying \nnotably on his incriminating statement. The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment \nfor a term of 15 months, and a 2 -year probation order was also issued against him.  \n(2) Quebec Court of Appeal, 2024 QCCA 86 (Schr ager, Healy and \nBachand  JJ.A.)  \n[15] The respondent appealed his conviction on two grounds. First, he argued \nthat the trial judge had erred in law by refusing to hold a voir dire  on the question of \nthe lawfulness of his arrest. Second, he alleged that the trial judge had erred in \nanalyzing the mens rea  for the offence of sexual assault.  \n[16] The court, per Healy J.A., found that the interpretation of s.  495(2) and (3) \nCr. C. adopted by the trial judge was incorrect.  \n[17] The court stated that s.  495(2) Cr. C. “excuses an e xercise of the power of \narrest without warrant that does not comply with the conditions stated in \nsection  495(1)” (para.  17). Section 495(3) Cr. C. “explicitly reserves to a person \narrested without warrant the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the  arrest upon \nallegation and proof” (para.  18). Refusal to hold a voir dire  on this question deprives \nthe person arrested of the benefit of s.  495(3) Cr. C., which  “expressly acknowledge[s]” \nthe possibility of holding a voir dire  on the lawfulness of an arr est without warrant \n(para.  19). \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n [18] In this case, the court held that there were valid grounds for the \nrespondent’s request for a voir dire , as there was no apparent basis on which to \nconclude that s.  495(2) Cr. C. justified such an arrest. By refusing to cond uct a voir \ndire, the trial judge had thus deprived the respondent of the opportunity to allege and \nestablish the unlawfulness of his arrest without warrant, an opportunity that he had on \na proper interpretation of s.  495(3) Cr. C. \n[19] Finding that the appeal s hould be allowed and a new trial ordered on the \nbasis of the first ground",

Since t hat question is not before our Court, there is no need \nfor us to address it.  \nIII. Issues  \n[20] This appeal is one involving statutory interpretation. We are not dealing \nwith a constitutional challenge to s.  495 Cr. C., nor do we have to rule on the merits of \nthe moti on filed by the respondent. Rather, the Court is called upon to determine \nwhether it was appropriate for the trial judge to summarily deny the respondent’s \nrequest that a voir dire  be held to decide the lawfulness of his arrest without warrant.  \n[21] An interpre tive exercise is required with respect to s.  495(2) and (3) Cr. C., \nbecause if s.  495(2) Cr. C. were  interpreted  as having no effect on the lawfulness of an \narrest, it would then become unnecessary to consider whether s.  495(3) Cr. C. prevents \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n the unlawful ness of that arrest from being raised in a criminal proceeding. A proper \ninterpretation of these two provisions, starting with s.  495(2) Cr. C., is therefore \nessential to determine the outcome of the appeal.  \n[22] Two questions can helpfully guide the interpreti ve analysis in this case.  \n[23] First, it must be determined whether s.  495(2) Cr. C., properly interpreted, \ncan have the effect of making an arrest unlawful under s.  9 of the Charter . Second, if \nthis is the case — which is what I conclude — it must be asked whe ther s.  495(3) Cr. C., \nproperly interpreted,  precludes an accused from alleging such an infringement of s.  9 \nof the Charter and seeking a remedy under s.  24 of the Charter  in the accused’s own \ntrial. \nIV. Analysis  \n Powers of Arrest Provided for in Section 495 Cr . C. \n[24] To properly identify the legal framework applicable to this appeal, and for \nease of reference, I will reproduce in full s.  495 Cr. C., which establishes one of the \npowers of arrest without warrant held by peace officers and delineates the contours of \nthis power:  \n495 (1)  A peace officer may arrest without warrant  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n \n (a) a person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on \nreasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an \nindictable offence;  \n(b) a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence; or  \n(c) a person in respect of whom he has reasonable grounds to believe \nthat a warrant of arrest or committal, in any form set out in Part  XXVIII \nin relation thereto, is in force within the territorial j urisdiction in which \nthe person is found.  \n(2) A peace officer shall not arrest  a person without warrant  for \n(a) an indictable offence mentioned in section 553,  \n(b) an offence for which the person may be prosecuted by indictment or \nfor which he is punishabl e on summary conviction, or  \n(c) an offence punishable on summary conviction,  \nin any case where  \n(d) he believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest , having \nregard to all the circumstances including the need to  \n(i) establish the identity of the pe rson,  \n(ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or  \n(iii) prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the \ncommission of another offence,  \nmay be satisfied without so arresting the person, and  \n(e) he has no reasonable ground s to believe that, if he does not so arrest \nthe person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with \naccording to law.  \n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a peace officer acting under subsection \n(1) is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution",

C. gives a peace officer \na power of arrest without warrant in three situations: where (1)  a person has committed \nan indictable offence, (2)  a person is about to commit an indictable offence, or (3)  the \npeace officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an indictable \noffence. But the power so conferred is not absolute.  \n[26] This is because s.  495 Cr. C. also includes subss.  (2) and  (3). These \nprovisions were described by both parties as limiting, circumscribing or restricting a \npeace officer’s discretion to make an arrest without warrant. The nature and scope of \nthese provisions are precisely what I clarify in these reasons.  \n History  of Arrest Without Warrant in Canada  \n[27] The power of peace officers to make arrests without warrant, which at one \ntime involved very broad discretion, was the subject of a major reform in which the \nfirst iterations of the provisions that are now s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) Cr. C. were \nenacted. At th e outset of the analysis, it is important to review the circumstances that \nled to their enactment, focusing more specifically on the report of the Canadian \nCommittee on Corrections (“Committee”) entitled Report of the Canadian Committee \non Corrections — Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections  (1969) (“ Ouimet \nReport ”) and the parliamentary debates that preceded their enactment.  \n(1) Ouimet Report  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n [28] Until 1972, the Criminal Code  did not regulate the exercise of the power \nof peace officers to make arrests with out warrant on the basis that an indictable offence \nhad been or was about to be committed or that a criminal offence was being committed. \nThe Criminal Code  simply stated the grounds required for an arrest to be legally \njustified, which can now be found in s. 495(1) (a) and (b) (see Crankshaw’s Criminal \nCode of Canada, R.S.C. 1985 (rev. ed. (loose -leaf)), at §  495:HIST). At the time, the \npower of arrest without warrant was set out in the following terms in s.  449 of the \nCriminal Code , R.S.C. 1970, c.  C-34 (“ Cr. C. (1970) ”): \n449. A peace officer may arrest without warrant  \n(a) a person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on \nreasonable and probable grounds, he believes has committed or is about \nto commit an indictable offence or is about to commit suicide,  \n(b) a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence, or  \n(c) a person for whose arrest he has reasonable and probable grounds to \nbelieve that a warrant is in force within the territorial jurisdiction in \nwhich that person is found.  \nHowever, no limitation was set out at the time in the Criminal Code  to narrow the sc ope \nof the former s.  449 Cr. C. (1970) , as is the case with the current s.  495(2) Cr. C., titled \n“Limitation” (“ Restriction ”). \n[29] In the 1960s, the federal government established the Committee, chaired \nby Justice Roger Ouimet, to study Canada’s correctional s ystem and recommend \ndesirable legislative changes. In 1969, the Ouimet Report  was released.

In 1969, the Ouimet Report  was released. The Committee \nconcluded from its survey of the powers of peace officers in Canada that these powers \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n maintained “a reasonable balance .  . . between the requirements of the general security \nand the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual” (p.  49). The Committee \nnevertheless noted that the power of peace officers to make arrests without warrant was \n“broad” (p.  91). The Committee was of the view that arres ts without warrant were too \nfrequent and were often not justified in the public interest, because in many cases other \nmethods would have sufficed to secure the accused’s attendance at trial (pp.  42 and \n92). \n[30] The Committee accordingly recommended that the Criminal Code  be \namended to incorporate public interest criteria that would govern decisions about \nwhether to make an arrest without warrant:  \nThe Committee therefore recommends that section 435 of the Criminal \nCode be amended to require not only reasonable g rounds to believe that \nthe person arrested has committed or is about to commit an indictable \noffence but also reasonable grounds to believe that immediate arrest is \nnecessary in the public interest and to provide that a police officer may \narrest a person w hom he finds committing an offence punishable on \nsummary conviction if he has reasonable grounds for believing that \nimmediate arrest is necessary in the public interest. [Emphasis deleted; \np. 92] \n(2) Enactment of the Bail Reform Act  \n[31] On the strength of those re commendations, the then Minister of Justice, \nJohn  N. Turner, introduced Bill C -218, which would become the Bail Reform Act , S.C. \n1970 -71-72, c.  37 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1970, c.  2 (2nd Supp.)), once it received royal \nassent. The purpose of that statute was  to implement two legislative reforms. The first \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n \n was designed to limit the use of arrest by replacing it with other methods, such as a \nsummons or an appearance notice. The second was aimed at remedying the injustice \nassociated with cash bail, which had the  effect of penalizing people who had limited \nfinancial resources and who were therefore obliged to find a surety. It is the first of \nthese reforms that is of interest to us here, because it forms the backdrop against which \nthe provisions equivalent to the current s.  495(2) and (3) Cr. C. were introduced.  \n[32] In the House of Commons, Minister Turner explained the reasons that had \nled the government to propose such a reform of the powers of arrest conferred on peace \nofficers. He stressed the importance of maintai ning public confidence in peace officers \n(House of Commons Debates , vol.  3, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., February 5, 1971, at p.  3114 \n(Hon.  J. Turner)). Although the Minister emphasized the central role of arrest in the \ncriminal process, he acknowledged that unn ecessary arrests could undermine such \nconfidence and that the law had to provide peace officers with clear guidelines for \njudging whether an arrest was necessary (p.  3114). The Minister therefore said that \nthere was a need to reform the legislation governi ng arrests without warrant by peace \nofficers.  \n[33] One of the bill’s stated objectives was to “avoid unnecessary pre -trial arrest \nand detention” ( House of Commons Debates , February 5, 1971, at p.  3116 (Hon. \nJ. Turner)). According to Minister Turner, the law the n in force did not give peace \nofficers the “flexibility or the .  . . guidelines” they needed to judge whether an arrest \nwithout warrant should be made (p.  3114). In order to avoid unnecessary arrests \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n \n without warrant, he believed that a peace officer “shoul d be obliged not to arrest \nwithout a warrant where he has reasonable and probable cause to believe that the public \ninterest may be secured by proceeding other than by arrest” (with an exception being \nmade, of course, for cases like murder or serious offenc es against public order)",

C. (1970)  (now \ns. 495(2) Cr. C.) would limit the power of arrest, the Minister stated the following:  \n. . . I assume that the criminal law in this country and every provision of \nit will be enforced with the best honest human judgment that it can be \nenforced by the police and the magistrates of this country. What this Bill \ndoes is alter the unfettered discretion of the police to arrest .  . . to a \ndiscretion that he mus t exercise not to arrest in a number of offences where \nhe has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the public interest \ncan be satisfied by not arresting.

It recognized “that \ndecisions by the police may have to be made under difficult conditions”, in other words, \nthat peace officers might be called upon to make quick decisions in the heat of the \naction ( House of Commons Debates , February 5, 1971, at p.  3116; see also p.  3117). It  \ntherefore sought to limit the consequences of such unnecessary arrests  for peace \nofficers themselves , notably by lessening the possibility of their conduct being the \nsubject of criminal or penal proceedings relating more specifically to their personal \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n \n liability, but also to that of any person responsible for those peace officers, such as their \nemployer.  \n[36] Minister Turner explained in this regard that if a police officer made a \nmistake by arresting someone without warrant even though this was not permitted \nunder the new limitations, “then that is a mistake in judgment for which the policeman \nwill not be penalized by criminal liability. He cannot be charged criminally for false \narrest” ( Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice \nand Legal Affairs , No.  8, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., February 23, 1971, at p.  7; see also \npp. 8-9). For a person arrested in violation of the then new limitations set out in the \nformer s.  450(2) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(2) Cr. C.), the only possible remedy wa s an \naward of damages in a civil suit relating more specifically to the conduct of the peace \nofficer who made the arrest without warrant.  \n[37] To the question of what would happen if a peace officer made an arrest \ncontrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C., Minister Turner r eplied as follows:  \nIf he arrests and it later turns out that, in judgment, he did not need to arrest \nbecause the public interest would have been served just as well or better by \nnot arresting, then that is a mistake in judgment for which the policeman \nwill not be penalized by criminal liability. He cannot be charged criminally \nfor false arrest.  \n. . . That means that the person who wants to sue civilly for having been \nbrought in to the desk and booked must establish that the policeman did \nhave reasonable and  probable grounds to believe that the public interest \ncould be satisfied without so arresting him . Instead of the policeman having \nto show that he had reasonable and probable grounds for arresting, the \nperson brought in had to show that there were reasonab le and probable \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n \n grounds for not arresting.

Secondly, if there are grounds \nfor arresting, are there grounds for bringing him in?

All that paragraph (b) says is that he is open to a civil suit \nif he makes a mistake in judgment but the burden of proof is on the person \nwho fe els that he has been wronged by the exercise of that judgment.  \nSo the ultimate sanction is a civil suit  and .  . . I believe that the police \nof this country, if they accept this Bill as I believe they will be, and I am \ntrying to listen to their objections b oth at the brotherhood level, and the \nassociation level, and the chiefs of police level — I think .  . . they will try \nto live within its sphere.

There have been \nno substantive amendm ents to the former s.  450(2) and (3) Cr. C. (1970)  since the \ninitial enactment thereof.  \n Jurisprudence on the Interpretation of Section 495(2) and (3) Cr.  C. \n[40] Appellate courts across the country have adopted an interpretation of \ns. 495(2) and (3) Cr. C. that is more in line with the approach put forward by the Crown \nin this case. This is, in the words of Healy  J.A., the “dominant view” (C.A. reasons, at \npara.  12, fn.  12). I propose to outline it by looking first at decisions rendered before the \nCharter  was en acted in 1982, then at those rendered after its enactment.  \n(1) Pre-Charter  Decisions  \n[41] Shortly after the passage of the Bail Reform Act , the current s.  495(3) Cr. C. \nwas considered by several appellate courts in this country. In all of those cases, one of \nthe ch arges involved was that of unlawfully resisting arrest (now s.  129(a) Cr. C.; \nformerly s.  118(2)).  \n[42] In R. v. Adams  (1972), 21 C.R.N.S. 257, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal \nheld that s.  495(3) “must be construed as denying the right to raise a defence, base d on \nthe non -compliance with subs.  (2), in any proceedings under the Code or under any \nother Act of Parliament” (p.  260). The court added that, in",

    "text": "2)).  \n[42] In R. v. Adams  (1972), 21 C.R.N.S. 257, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal \nheld that s.  495(3) “must be construed as denying the right to raise a defence, base d on \nthe non -compliance with subs.  (2), in any proceedings under the Code or under any \nother Act of Parliament” (p.  260). The court added that, in its opinion, “because of \nsubs.  (3) no reliance can be placed on subs.  (2) to establish that the peace officer , for \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n \n non-compliance with the requirements of that subsection, was not acting lawfully and \nin the execution of his duty” ( ibid.). \n[43] That reasoning was followed by the courts of appeal of British Columbia \nand Alberta, respectively, in R. v. McKibbon (1973), 1 2 C.C.C. (2d) 66 (B.C.C.A.), at \np. 70, and R. v. Fuhr , [1975] 4 W.W.R. 403 (Alta. C.A.), at p.  406. \n[44] In McKibbon , the respondent was charged with assaulting a peace officer \nwith intent to resist lawful arrest, although no charge was laid against him for the  \nunderlying offence of impaired driving. The British Columbia Court of Appeal \nfollowed Adams  and concluded as follows:  \n[Subsection (3)], which specifically applies notwithstanding s -s. (2), \nmakes it clear that a peace officer who acts under s -s. (1)(a) is deemed to \nbe acting lawfully for the purposes, inter alia , of any proceedings under \nthe Criminal Code . In my view, that means that as he is arresting without \nwarrant with the grounds and belief set out in s -s. (1)(a), he is still acting \nlawfully and his a rrest is lawful. [p.  70] \n[45] In Fuhr , the Alberta Court of Appeal also followed Adams in the context \nof a charge of unlawfully resisting a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty:  \nI am of the view that the limitations set out in subs.  (2) of the pow ers \ngranted a peace officer under subs.  (1) do not afford a defence to the \npresent charge, in view of the deeming words found in subs.  (3). \nSubsection (3) provides that if a peace officer is acting under subs.  (1), he \nis deemed to be acting lawfully and in  the execution of his duty for the \npurposes of any proceedings under the Code. [p.  406] \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n [46] It goes without saying that the question of whether a motion under s.  9 of \nthe Charter could be brought to challenge the validity of an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) \nCr. C. was not addressed in those cases, as the Charter  had not yet been enacted. Prior \nto its enactment, the recourses available to an accused who had been unlawfully \narrested were very limited and amounted mainly to the possibility of raising a defence \nagainst a charge of obstruction or resisting arrest. Not only did peace officers have \nbroad discretion at the time to make arrests without warrant, but courts could exercise \ntheir discretion to exclude evidence only in rare circumstances, where a very high \nthreshold was met ( R. v. Wray , [1971] S.C.R. 272, at p.  293; see also S.  Coughlan, \n“Threading Together Abuse of Process and Exclusion of Evidence: How it Became \nPossible to Rebuke Mr.  Big” (2015), 71 S.C.L.R . (2d) 415, at pp.  429-30). Among other \nthings, c ourts did not have the power — which they do today under s.  24 of the  \nCharter — to exclude evidence on the ground that its admission would bring the \nadministration of justice into disrepute ( Wray , at p. 287, per Martland  J.). \n[47] The decisions rendered by certa in appellate courts in this country on the \ninterpretation of s.  495(3) Cr.

Indeed, the analysis in those decisions is based on the law \napplicable since the coming into force of t he Charter , just like the analysis that this \nCourt must undertake in the instant case.  \n(2) Post-Charter  Decisions  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n [48] Since the advent of the Charter , most of the decisions interpreting s.  495(3) \nCr. C. and its interaction with s.  9 of the Charter  have found that every criminal \nproceeding — regardless of the identity of the accused — is a “proceedin[g] under [ the \nCriminal Code ] or any other Act of Parliament” contemplated by s.  495(3 )(a) Cr. C. \n[49] In R. v. Cayer  (1988), 28 O.A.C. 105, a decision rendered by the Ontari o \nCourt of Appeal in 1988, the issue was whether the effect of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. was \nthat an arrest authorized by s.  495(1) Cr. C. became unlawful where the requirements \nof s. 495(2) Cr. C. were breached. The Ontario Court of Appeal, relying on the reaso ns \ngiven in Adams and McKibbon , adopted the following interpretation of s.  450(2) and \n(3) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(2) and (3) Cr. C.) (at para. 33): \n. . . notwithstanding subs.  (2), a peace officer exercising his power under \ns. 450(1) is deemed to be acti ng lawfully and in the execution of his duty \nfor the purposes of any proceedings under the Criminal Code or any other \nAct of Parliament. Thus, a peace officer exercising his power of arrest \nwithout warrant under s.  450(1) is deemed by s.  450(3) to be actin g \nlawfully for the purpose of any proceedings under the Code or any other \nAct of Parliament, even though, in arresting a person without warrant he \nhas breached the duty imposed on him by s.  450(2) not to arrest the accused \nin the circumstances therein spec ified . . . \n[50] Further on, the Ontario Court of Appeal added that “[t]he fact that the arrest \nmay contravene s.  450(2) [now s.  495(2)] of the Code  does not ipso facto  make it \narbitrary under s.  9 of the Charter . If the arrest does contravene s.  450(2) of the Code , \nit is, of course, lawful under s.  450(3)” (Cayer , at para.  46). The court ultimately \nconcluded that there had been no contravention of s.  495(2) because it was not \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n “unreasonable in the public interest to arrest the accused to prevent the continuation  or \nrepetition of the offence” (para.  47). \n[51] Nearly 30 years later, in R. v. Jowett Work , 2019 BCCA 236, 379 C.C.C. \n(3d) 187, the British Columbia Court of Appeal also had to interpret s.  495(3) Cr. C . \nIn that case, the accused had been arrested without warrant for theft and, in a search \nincident to the arrest, the police had discovered drugs. During the voir dire  to determine \nthe lawfulness of the arrest, the trial judge found that the officers had bre ached the \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. , thereby making the arrest unlawful.  \n[52] The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and \nadmitted the evidence from the search incident to the arrest. The court noted that \ns. 495(3)(a) Cr. C. expre ssly applies “for the purpose of ‘any proceedings’ under the  \nCriminal Code ” (Jowett Work , at para.  38). In",

C. , thereby making the arrest unlawful.  \n[52] The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and \nadmitted the evidence from the search incident to the arrest. The court noted that \ns. 495(3)(a) Cr. C. expre ssly applies “for the purpose of ‘any proceedings’ under the  \nCriminal Code ” (Jowett Work , at para.  38). In the court’s view, the effect of the \nprovision is to make the peace officer’s conduct “lawfu[l] and the arrest .  . . lawful as \nlong as the Crown estab lishes that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to \narrest under s.  495(1)(a) or (b)” (para.  32). Thus, in its opinion, there was no need to \nconsider s.  495(2) Cr. C., as any non -compliance with that provision would not, in a \ncriminal proceeding , render an otherwise lawful arrest unlawful, in light of the \npresumption of lawfulness in s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. (para.  30). \n[53] In R. v. Veen , 2022 ABCA 350, 51 Alta. L.R. (7th) 417, the Alberta Court \nof Appeal in turn addressed the interpretation of s.  495(3) Cr. C.  In that case, the \naccused had been arrested and then detained at the police station after being found by \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n the police in the driver’s seat of his truck with an empty beer can nearby. In a voir dire  \nbased on s.  9 of the Charter  held during his trial, t he accused challenged the lawfulness \nof his arrest, believing it to be contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. The Alberta Court of Queen’s \nBench (sitting on appeal from the decision of the Alberta Provincial Court) granted the \naccused’s request for a voir dire  and e xcluded the evidence obtained following the \narrest. In its opinion, “[s]ubsection (3) should not be interpreted as overriding the duty \nnot to arrest[, because it] is relevant in instances where a police officer is facing \ncriminal liability” ( R. v. Veen , 2020 ABQB 99, 10 Alta. L.R. (7th) 192, at para.  74). \n[54] For its part, the Alberta Court of Appeal was of the view that the appeal \nshould be allowed and the evidence obtained following the accused’s arrest admitted. \nIt found that while the police officer may hav e made a mistake in judgment by arresting \nthe accused without warrant, that mistake did not negate the lawfulness of the arrest \nunder s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. As a result, the accused could not raise non -compliance with \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. as a defence.  However, t he Court of Appeal specified that this type of \nmistake could be the subject of a civil suit or internal disciplinary measures against the \npolice officer concerned under s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. In support of that conclusion, the \nCourt of Appeal relied in part o n pre -Charter  case law as well as on the wording of \ns. 495(3)(a) Cr. C. itself and the parliamentary debates.  \nD. Principles of Statutory Interpretation  \n[55] There is now only one approach to statutory interpretation in Canada, \nnamely the approach requiring that th e words of a provision be interpreted “in their \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the \nscheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” ( Rizzo & \nRizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para.  21, quoting E.  A. Driedger, \nConstruction of Statutes  (2nd ed. 1983), at p.  87; see also R. v. Basque , 2023 SCC 18, \nat para.  63; R. v. Wolfe , 2024 SCC 34). I will therefore use this approach to first \ndetermine the proper interpretation to be given to s. 495(2) Cr. C., and I will then do \nthe same",

I will therefore use this approach to first \ndetermine the proper interpretation to be given to s. 495(2) Cr. C., and I will then do \nthe same for s.  495(3) Cr. C. \n[56] In this case, the wording of the provisions to be interpreted concerning the \npower of arrest without warrant came into force nearly a decade before the enactment \nof the Charter , which in troduced new safeguards in relation to arrest. In this context, it \nis important to remember that the statutory interpretation exercise is focused “on the \nintent of the legislature at the time of enactment  and courts are bound to give effect to \nthat intent” ( Telus Communications Inc. v. Federation of Canadian Municipalities , \n2025 SCC 15, at para.  32 (emphasis added); see also paras.  33-36; Perka v. The Queen , \n[1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, at pp.  264-66; R. v.

Devinat, Interprétation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para.  24; \nR. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), a t § 6.01[1]).  \n[57] Having briefly outlined these principles, I turn now to the interpretation of \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n \n Interpretation of Section 495(2) Cr.  C.: Can Non -compliance With \nSection  495(2) Cr.  C. Have the Effect of Making an Arrest Without Warrant \nUnlawful  and Thus Arbitrary Within the Meaning of Section 9 of the Charter?  \n(1) Text of Section 495(2) Cr. C. \n[58] As I indicated at the outset, the modern approach to statutory interpretation \nmakes the text the “anchor of the interpretative exercise”, because the text specifies the \nmeans chosen by Parliament to achieve its purposes and attain its goals ( Piekut v. \nCanada (National Revenue) , 2025 SCC 13, at para.  45, quoting Quebec (Commission \ndes droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Directrice de la pro tection de \nla jeunesse du CISSS  A, 2024 SCC 43, at para.  24). \n[59] In general terms, s.  495(2) Cr. C. provides that a peace officer shall not \narrest a person without warrant in certain circumstances, but only for a restricted \nnumber of offences. The scope of s.  495(2) Cr. C. is therefore limited — the provision \napplies only to hybrid offences and offences punishable on summary conviction, as \nwell as to the indictable offences mentioned in s.  553 Cr. C. The offences referred to \nin s. 553 Cr. C. are indictable off ences within the exclusive jurisdiction of a provincial \ncourt judge (e.g., theft (other than theft of cattle), betting, breach of a recognizance or \nfailure to comply with a probation order). By operation of s.  34 of the Interpretation \nAct, R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-21, s.  495(2)(b) and s.  495(2)(c) Cr. C. also apply to offences \ncreated by legislation other than the Criminal Code , including the Controlled Drugs \nand Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c.  19, or other Acts of Parliament . \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n [60] Section 495(2) prevents a peace officer  from making an arrest without \nwarrant where two requirements are met.

First, the peace officer must believe on \nreasonable grounds that the public interest may be satisfied without making an arrest \nwithout warrant (s.  495(2)(d)). Second, the peace officer must have no reasonable \ngrounds to believe that, if he or she does not arrest the person without warrant, the \nperson will fail to attend court (s.  495(2)(e)).  \n[61] I note, as the parties do, that s.  495(2) Cr. C. applies only when the two \nrequirements set out i n s. 495(2)(d) and (e ) Cr. C. are met. The use of the word “and” \nat the end of the English version of s.  495(2)( d) Cr. C., and of the expressions “ d’une \npart” and “ d’autre part ” in the French version of s.  495(2)(d) and (e),  clearly supports \nsuch a cumulat ive reading. A peace officer cannot make an arrest without warrant if \nthe requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. are met. However, if one of the requirements is not \nmet, the officer can arrest a person without warrant. To conclude otherwise would in \nfact have the absurd consequence of preventing a peace officer from making an arrest \nwithout warrant, thereby running the risk, for example, of allowing evidence to be \ndestroyed right before his or her eyes, even if the officer does not consider the person \nto be a fli ght risk. Parliament cannot have intended such a result.  \n[62] It follows that, in a scenario where one of the conditions in s.  495(2) Cr. C. \nwas not met, a peace officer could make an arrest without warrant under s.  495(1) \nCr. C. Thus, the peace officer would be authorized to make such an arrest if he or she \nbelieved on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to do so, either to satisfy the public \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n interest or to ensure the person’s appearance in court. Conversely, the peace officer \ncould not make such an arres t if it was not necessary to do so in order to satisfy the \npublic interest or to ensure the person’s attendance in court.  \n[63] I turn my attention now to the heart of the appellant’s argument with \nrespect to s.  495(2) Cr. C. Does the text of this provision sugg est that peace officers \nhave a mandatory obligation to verify that the two requirements set out in s.  495(2)(d) \nand (e) Cr. C. are not met before making an arrest without warrant, or does it only \nconstitute non -binding guidelines whose purpose is simply to  delineate the exercise of \ntheir discretion?  \n[64] There are very strong textual indications within s.  495(2) Cr. C. that this \nprovision is of a mandatory nature. The English text of s.  495(2) Cr. C. states that a \npeace officer “shall not” arrest a person withou t warrant where the two requirements \nmentioned are met. In my view, an obligation  not to make an arrest can be inferred \nfrom the use of the words “shall not arrest” (“ ne peut arrêter ” in the French version).  \n[65] This Court wrote in Bessette v. British Columbia  (Attorney General) , 2019 \nSCC 31, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 535, at para.  25, that the rule of interpretation codified in s.  11 \nof the Interpretation Act  provides that “‘[s]hall’ is mandatory language” (“ [l]e présent \nde l’indicatif indique l’obligation ”). In this ca se, the use of the expression “shall  not” \n(“ne peut ”) reflects Parliament’s intention to achieve its objectives (to which I will \nreturn) by imposing on peace officers a strict prohibition against arresting a person \nwithout warrant where certain cumulative conditions are met.

As with many other \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n provisions of the Criminal Code , the word “shall” (and, in French, the use of the present \nindicative) in s.  495(2) Cr. C. should be construed as expressing an obligation; the word \n“shall” should be understood to mean “must” (see, e.g., R. v. Johnson , 2003 SCC 46, \n[2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, at para.  16; see also Baron v. Canada , [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at \npp. 422-23). It thus differs from the word “may” (“ pouvoir ”), which generally \n“connotes a measure of discretion” ( Canada (Att orney General) v. Mavi , 2011 SCC 30, \n[2011] 2 S.C.R. 504, at para.  54). \n[66] In short, the text of the provision suggests that, in practice, peace officers \nhave an obligation, before making any arrest without warrant, to assess whether the \npublic interest can b e satisfied and the person’s attendance in court ensured in some \nother way. This would therefore mean that peace officers should refrain from making \nsuch an arrest where they believe on reasonable grounds that these two conditions are \nmet. \n(2) Context  \n[67] The cont ext of s.  495(2) Cr. C. also supports this interpretation. For a clear \nunderstanding of the scope of this provision, it is important to look first at the \nrelationship between s.  495(1) and s.  495(2) Cr. C. and then at the relationship between \ns. 495(2) and  s. 495(3) Cr. C. \n(a) Relationship Between Section 495(1) and Section 495(2) Cr. C. \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n [68] In legislative drafting, it is common practice to begin by formulating a \ngeneral rule and then to clarify or narrow the rule by means of more specific provisions. \nIn such cases , the general rule and the specific rules must be read together: the specific \nrules qualify the general rule stated first and reveal its true scope in a particular situation \n(Côté and Devinat, at paras.  1074 et seq.).  \n[69] This is precisely the logic underlying  the relationship between s.  495(1) \nand s.  495(2) Cr. C. Section 495(2) Cr. C. does not create a  freestanding power of arrest \nwithout warrant. This power has its normative source exclusively in s.  495(1) Cr. C. \nAs many have already pointed out, s.  495(1) Cr. C. remains the foundation and \ncornerstone of the power of arrest without warrant ( Jowett Work , at para.  34; Veen  \n(C.A.),  at para.  34; J.  A. Scollin, The Bail Reform Act: An Analysis of Amendments to \nthe Criminal Code Related to Bail and Arrest  (1972), at p.  4). Section 495(2) Cr. C. \nmust therefore be understood as a provision that serves to limit the scope of the general \npower of arrest provided for in s.  495(1) Cr. C. when certain requirements are met.  \n[70] It is thus incorrect to say that s.  495(2) Cr. C. permits the exercise of such \na power regardless of the conditions set out in s.  495(1) Cr. C. Section 495(2) Cr. C. \ncannot come into play unless a peace officer first believes on reasonable grounds that \nan indictable offence has been or is about to be committed, the officer finds a person \ncommitting a criminal offence or the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that \nthere is a warrant for the person’s arrest or committal, in accordance with s.  495(1) \nCr.

It logically follows that the determination of whether s.  495(2)  \nCr. C. applies must always begin with the question of the application of s.  495(1)  \nCr. C.: if the latter does not apply or is not comp lied with, consideration of s.  495(2)  \nCr. C. becomes moot.  \n[71] In summary, s.  495(1 ) Cr. C. differs from s.  495(2) in that it provides that \na peace officer “may arrest without warrant .  . . a person” (“ peut arrêter sans mandat \n. . . une personne ”), whereas s.  495(2)  Cr. C. instead says “shall not arrest a person \nwithout warrant” (“ ne peut arrêter une personne sans mandat ”). Section 495(1)  Cr. C. \nis therefore permissive, because it makes a grant of powers, rights, authorizations or \npermissions ( Interpretation Ac t, s. 11, the French version of which refers to “ [l]’octroi \nde pouvoirs, de droits, d’autorisations ou de facultés ”) and thus connotes the existence \nof “an area of discretion” ( Smith & Rhuland Ltd. v. The Queen , [1953] 2 S.C.R. 95, at \np. 97). The contrast between “may” (“ peut”) and “shall not” (“ ne peut ”) in s.  495 Cr. C. \nreinforces the idea that Parliament’s intention was to confer a certain degree of \ndiscretion on peace officers in s.  495(1)  Cr. C. but to impose an obligation or duty on \nthem in s.  495(2)  Cr. C. (see, e.g., Dagg v. Canada (Minister of Finance) , [1997] 2 \nS.C.R. 403, at para.  108, per La Forest  J., dissenting, but not on this point).  \n[72] I also observe that the marginal note to s.  495(2)  Cr. C. is titled  \n“Limitation” (“ Restriction ”). While this marginal note is not part of the content of the \nprovision ( Interpretation Act , s. 14), it does serve as an additional indication that \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n s. 495(2) Cr. C. should be interpreted as imposing binding limitations on the powers \nset out in s.  495(1)  Cr. C. \n(b) Relations hip Between Section 495(2) and Section 495(3) Cr.  C. \n[73] Continuing with my analysis of the context of the provision, I will look at \nthe relationship between s.  495(2) Cr. C. and s.  495(3) Cr. C. I note that the very \nexistence of s.  495(3) Cr. C. is a contextu al element of no small importance in \nconfirming the binding and mandatory nature of s.  495(2) Cr. C. Indeed, if s.  495(2) \nCr. C. had no normative import, there would have been no need to create a form of \npresumption of lawfulness “[n]otwithstanding subsect ion (2)” (“ [n]onobstant le \nparagraphe (2) ”) in s.  495(3) Cr. C. Section 495(3) Cr. C. therefore also suggests that \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. imposes a real obligation, since subs.  (3) contains protective \nmechanisms in the event of non -compliance with subs.

(3) contains protective \nmechanisms in the event of non -compliance with subs.  (2). \n(c) Conclusion on the Context of Section 495(2) Cr.  C. \n[74] In summary, an analysis of the context of s.  495(1), (2) and (3)  Cr. C. \nreveals a coherent legislative structure in which each provision plays a complementary \nrole. Section 495(1) Cr. C. creates a power of  arrest without warrant, while s.  495(2) \nCr. C. strictly regulates the exercise of this power by imposing binding limitations. The \nexistence of s.  495(3) Cr. C. confirms the normative character of s.  495(2) Cr. C. by \nsetting out protective mechanisms in th e event of non -compliance.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n (3) Purpose of Section 495(2) Cr. C. \n[75] Interpreting s.  495(2) Cr. C. as limiting a peace officer’s power of arrest is \nalso consistent with the purpose of this provision.  \n[76] Indeed, as I mentioned above, s.  495(2) Cr. C. was enacted as par t of a bill \naimed at reducing “unnecessary pre -trial arrest and detention” by limiting \n“discretionary injustice” ( House of Commons Debates , February 5, 1971, at p.  3116; \nsee also pp.  3114 and 3118) . To achieve this objective, Parliament wanted “new duties \n. . . placed on the police to direct their minds to what the public interest requires”, but \nalso wanted peace officers to be given the “flexibility or the .  . . guidelines that would \nhelp [them] in judging whether or not an arrest should be made ” (pp. 3114  and 3116 -17 \n(Hon. J.  Turner) ). \n[77] The appellant interprets this passage from the parliamentary debates as \nindicating that Parliament’s objective was to increase the discretion  of peace officers \nto make arrests without warrant (A.F., at para.  44). I respectfu lly disagree.  \n[78] Even though Parliament, as part of its legislative reform, equipped peace \nofficers with new tools to avoid resorting to arrest — such as the possibility of issuing \nan appearance notice — its intention and the legislative objective were not to  leave \ntheir discretion intact, but rather to limit it. In keeping with the stated objective of \nreducing unnecessary arrests without warrant, Minister Turner explained that the \nlegislation was meant to “alter the unfettered discretion of the police to arrest” that had \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n existed until then under the Criminal Code , so as to limit it to “a discretion that he must \nexercise not to arrest in a number of offences where he has reasonable and probable \ngrounds to believe that the public interest can be satisfied by not arresting” ( Minutes of \nProceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committ ee on Justice and Legal Affairs , \nMarch 4, 1971, at p.  14). Thus, Minister Turner emphasized that the bill “convert[ed] \nthe discretion into a duty not to arrest” when certain requirements were met (p.  9 \n(emphasis added)).  \n[79] In my opinion, Parliament intended that a peace officer’s exercise of the \npower of arrest without warrant be strictly regulated through the mandatory \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. in order to promote the public interest and ensure the \nperson’s appearance in court. The purpose of s.  495(2 ) Cr. C. is therefore  clear: it is to \nlimit the discretion of police officers by identifying the situations in which an arrest \nwithout warrant is not required in order to reduce what are considered to be unnecessary \narrests. Interpreting s. 495(2) Cr. C. as simply setting out guidelines would therefore \nbe contrary to what Parliament intended, since it would not effectively assist in \nreducing unnecessary arrests without warrant.  \n(4) Constitutionality of the Public Interest Criterion  \n[80] The appellant argues that fin ding s.  495(2) Cr.

C. as simply setting out guidelines would therefore \nbe contrary to what Parliament intended, since it would not effectively assist in \nreducing unnecessary arrests without warrant.  \n(4) Constitutionality of the Public Interest Criterion  \n[80] The appellant argues that fin ding s.  495(2) Cr. C. to be mandatory would \nraise constitutional issues because of the overly vague nature of the public interest \ncriterion (A.F., at paras.  53, 82 and 84). The appellant relies in particular on R. v. \nMorales , [1992] 3 S.C.R. 711, in which this Court held that “the criterion of ‘public \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n interest’ as a basis for pre -trial detention under s.  515(10)( b) violate[d] s.  11(e) of the \nCharter because it authorize[d] detention in terms which [were] vague and imprecise” \n(p. 726).  \n[81] Here, the Court does n ot have squarely before it a constitutional challenge \nto s. 495(2)(d) Cr. C. based on s.  7 of the Charter  and the constitutional doctrine of \nvagueness, as it did in Morales . Nor does the Court have before it a constitutional \nchallenge to the “public intere st” criterion in s.  495(2)(d) Cr. C. under s.  9 of the \nCharter . In my view, this is sufficient to reject the appellant’s arguments in this regard.  \n(5) Conclusion on the Interpretation of Section 495(2) Cr. C. \n[82] I therefore find that an analysis of the text, cont ext and purpose of s.  495(2) \nCr. C. leads to the conclusion that the limitations imposed on the power of arrest \nwithout warrant are mandatory in nature. This provision requires peace officers, in \norder to properly exercise their discretion to arrest a pers on without warrant, to assess \nwhether the arrest is justified in the public interest and whether there is a risk that the \naccused will not appear. When the conditions set out in para.  (d), para.  (e) and any of \nparas.  (a) to (c) of s.  495(2) Cr. C. are met,  an arrest without warrant is prohibited. \nThus, peace officers contravene s.  495(2) Cr. C. where they fail to assess these criteria \nbefore acting or where they — wrongly — make an arrest without warrant when the \nconditions (if they are met) do not permit t hem to do so.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n [83] It follows from the above that an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. is \nunlawful because it is contrary to this law, which suffices to characterize said arrest as \narbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of the Charter . Indeed, since the enactme nt of the \nCharter in 1982, this Court has had occasion to state that an unlawful arrest or \ndetention, including one not authorized by law, is necessarily an arbitrary arrest or \ndetention and infringes s.  9 of the Charter (R. v. Grant , 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2  S.C.R. \n353, at para.  54; R. v. Tim , 2022 SCC 12, [2022] 1 S.C.R. 234, at paras.  21-22; R. v. \nLe, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para.  124).  \n[84] Since I am of the view that an arrest contrary to the law established by \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. results in this arr est made in violation of binding norms being unlawful, \nthis is sufficient to characterize such an arrest as arbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of \nthe Charter . The question that now remains is whether the effect of s.  495(3) Cr. C. is \nto shield such an ar rest from being found unlawful and thus arbitrary under s.  9 of the \nCharter , such that it would be manifestly frivolous to conduct a voir dire  to determine, \nin a criminal proceeding (such as the trial of the respondent in this case), the",

C.: Does Section 495(3) Cr.  C. Apply Where \na Criminal Proceeding Is Not Against the Peace Officer Who Made the Arrest?  \n[85] The main source of disagreement between the parties with resp ect to \ns. 495(3) Cr. C. lies in para.  (a) of this provision. This paragraph sets out the \npresumption that, notwithstanding s.  495(2) Cr. C., a peace officer who complies with \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n s. 495(1) is “acting lawfully and in the execution of his duty” for the purposes of \nvarious proceedings, subject to certain conditions.  \n[86] It is not in dispute that this paragraph serves, among other things, to provide \na peace officer who has made an arrest without warrant with protection in a criminal \nproceeding where that officer is per sonally facing a criminal charge for failure to \ncomply with s.  495(2) Cr. C., despite the fact that the officer complied with s.  495(1) \nCr. C. As Minister Turner explained, the bill was drafted in such a way that a peace \nofficer could not be prevented from  acting “for fear of a criminal suit in the exercise of \nhis discretion” ( Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on \nJustice and Legal Affairs , March 4, 1971, at p.  11). It is also not in dispute that \ns. 495(3)(b) Cr. C. nevertheless a llows a person who has been arrested and believes the \narrest to be contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. to bring a civil suit against the peace officer, or \nthe officer’s employer, in order to establish that the officer did not comply with the \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. and thus to obtain damages as a remedy (see, e.g., \nHudson v. Brantford Police Services  Board  (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont. C.A.); \nCollins v. Brantford Police Services Board  (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 405 (Ont. C.A.)).  \n[87] However, the appellant pr oposes a broader interpretation of this provision. \nHe argues that s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. is not confined to criminal proceedings in which a \nperson — particularly the peace officer who made the arrest without warrant, but also, \nfor example, the officer’s emplo yer — is facing criminal liability for non -compliance \nwith s.  495(2) Cr. C. According to the appellant, s.  495(3)(a) applies more broadly to \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n all criminal proceedings, including the trial of the respondent in this case. In other \nwords, an arrest made in com pliance with s.  495(1) Cr. C. would be presumed to be \nlawful for the purposes of “any proceedings” under the Criminal Code  or any other Act \nof Parliament, regardless of the proceeding and the statute under which it is brought, \nand regardless of the identit y of the accused and the basis for the charges laid against \nhim or her.  Other than in the decision under appeal before us, this interpretation is the \none that has generally been adopted thus far by appellate courts in the other provinces \n(see for example: Veen , Jowett Work  and Cayer ). \n[88] The effect of such an interpretation is as follows: an arrest contrary to \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. will necessarily be lawful because of s.  495(3) Cr. C. and will not make \nan arrest arbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of the  Charter . Consequently, a motion \nunder s.  9 of the Charter  —",

Consequently, a motion \nunder s.  9 of the Charter  — alleging non -compliance with s.  495(2) Cr. C. — will \ninevitably have to be dismissed, as it will be doomed to failure from the start.  \n[89] In my view, when read in light of the context and purpose of the provision, \nits text weighs in favour of a narrow interpretation of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. that is confined \nto preventing a peace officer or any person to whom the officer reports from being held \nliable in a proceeding under the Criminal Code  or any other Act of Parliament for \nnon-compliance with s.  495(2) Cr. C. This therefore means that one of the effects of \ns. 495(3)(a) Cr. C. is that a peace officer cannot be held criminally liable, in a criminal \nproceeding against the officer, for having contravened s.  495(2) Cr. C. when arresting \na person without warrant. Despite its broad and general language, s.  495(3) Cr. C. \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n applies in a very narrow and specific context, namely where the liability of a peace \nofficer or a person responsible for that officer is in issue o n the ground that the peace \nofficer allegedly breached the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C., even though the officer \ncomplied with those of s.  495(1) Cr. C. \n[90] Section 495(3) Cr. C. therefore does not apply in the criminal trial of the \nperson arrested without  warrant. Nor does it apply where a Charter  motion is brought \nin the course of such a criminal trial. It follows that accused persons can assert in their \nown criminal trial that their arrest without warrant, which they believe to be contrary \nto s. 495(2) Cr. C., constitutes an infringement of the Charter . \n[91] To support this reasoning, I consider the text, context and purpose of the \nprovision. This leads me to conclude that the interpretive approach adopted by certain \nappellate courts — including that of the C ourt of Appeal in some respects in this case  — \nis, and I say this with great respect, incorrect.  \n(1) The Text of Section 495(3) Cr. C. Supports Two Interpretations  \n[92] I begin my analysis by focusing on the text of s.  495(3) Cr. C. Generally \nspeaking, the language  of s.  495(3) Cr. C. can be described as establishing a \npresumption of lawfulness. Indeed, this provision states that, notwithstanding s.  495(2) \nCr. C., a peace officer acting under s.  495(1) “is deemed to be acting lawfully  and in \nthe execution of his dut y” in two situations:  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n (1) for the purposes of any proceedings under the Criminal Code or any \nother Act of Parliament (s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C.); and  \n(2) for the purposes of any other proceedings, unless the person alleging \na contravention of s.  495(2) Cr. C. establishe s that the peace officer \ndid not comply with the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. \n(s. 495(3)(b) Cr. C.). \n[93] The text of s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. is clear. The parties all agree that this \nprovision does not prevent a person who alleges an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. \nfrom bringing a civil suit against the arresting peace officer or a person responsible for \nthat officer for non -compliance with s.  495(2) Cr.

C. \n[94] This provision gives the peace officer or a person responsible for that \nofficer the benefit of a rebu ttable presumption to the effect that the officer acted \nlawfully and in the execution of his or her duty, that is, in compliance with the \nrequirements of s.  495 Cr. C. This presumption can be displaced. The person arrested \nmust be able to show that the req uirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. directing the peace \nofficer not to make an arrest without warrant were met, in other words, that the peace \nofficer believed on reasonable grounds that the public interest could be satisfied \nwithout so arresting the person and that there was no risk of the person failing to appear \nin court.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n [95] It is possible that s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. also covers police conduct \nproceedings under provincial or federal legislation enacted to that end. However, there \nis no need to decide this question f or the purposes of this appeal.  \n[96] With regard to s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C., the appellant and all of the intervening \nattorneys general propose a reading of the text that is related to the arrest, emphasizing \nthe grammatical and ordinary meaning of the phrase “any proceedings under [the \nCriminal Code ] or any other Act of Parliament” (see Veen  (C.A.), at para.  50). They \ntake the view, as the Alberta Court of Appeal found in Veen , that if Parliament had \nintended that s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. essentially be confined to prev enting peace officers — \nor their employers — from being convicted of an offence in a criminal proceeding on \nthe basis of non -compliance with s.  495(2) Cr. C., then Parliament could easily have \nsaid so (see also I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at paras.  10-22; I.F., Attorney \nGeneral of Alberta, at paras.  17-20; Veen  (C.A.), at para.  50). However, they argue, \nParliament did not express itself in such a narrow fashion. It is therefore clear, in their \nopinion, that s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. would apply even in the  criminal trial of the person \narrested without warrant, like the trial of the respondent in this case, because it would \nbe — in a broad sense — a proceeding under the Criminal Code  or any other Act of \nParliament.  \n[97] In my view, the grammatical and ordinary me aning of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. \nalso supports  another interpretation, one that is more consistent with the provision’s \npurpose and context that I consider below.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n [98] I draw attention to the wording chosen by Parliament: “.  . . a peace officer \nacting under [s.  495(1)] is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution of his \nduty” (“ . . . un agent de la paix agissant aux termes du [par. 495(1)] est censé agir \nlégalement et dans l’exercice de ses fonctions ”) (s.  495(3) Cr. C.). In light of this \nwording, I note tha t the text also supports the interpretation that s.  495(3)(a) and \ns. 495(3)(b) in fact require that the proceedings be directly aimed at the conduct of the \npeace officer who made the arrest contrary to the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C., \nwhich is to say that the court will look at the peace officer’s own actions to determine \nthe liability of that officer, the officer’s employer or any other person who may have \nproceedings brought against him or her and be held liable for the peace officer’s \nconduct . \n[99] From this perspective, the presumption of lawfulness set out in s.  495(3) \nCr. C. would apply only to the peace officer’s actions for the purposes of determining \nthe liability of the officer or of a person responsible for the officer",

C. would apply only to the peace officer’s actions for the purposes of determining \nthe liability of the officer or of a person responsible for the officer. The lawfulness of \nthe peace  officer’s conduct  (in the context of a civil liability suit or criminal \nprosecution) would be a very different question than the lawfulness of the arrest  under \nthe Criminal Code  and the Charter . \n[100]  A plain reading of the words used in s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. therefore reveals \nan ambiguity as regards the scope of this provision, in that they can reasonably support \ntwo interpretations. However, I am of the view that it is not a “real” ambiguity in the \nsense discussed in Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex , 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n S.C.R. 559, at paras.  29-30, since the true meaning of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. can be \nascertained from the context and the purpose underlying it  (La Presse inc. v. Quebec , \n2023 SCC 22, at paras.  23-24). The statutory interpretation exerci se would in any event \nbe incomplete without looking to the context and purpose of this provision ( Wolfe , at \npara.  32; R. v. Alex , 2017 SCC 37, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 967, at para.  31). Here, the context \nand purpose of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. indicate that the presump tion of lawfulness in \ns. 495(3) Cr. C. applies solely to the conduct of the peace officer who makes the arrest \nthat is considered to be contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. In other words, they confirm that a \nnarrow reading of the provision must be adopted.  \n(2) Purpos e of Section 495(3) Cr. C. \n[101]  I continue my analysis by focusing on the purpose of the provision. It is \nwell settled that a court engaged in statutory interpretation is not required to follow any \nstrict order in examining the text, context and purpose ( Piekut , at para.  43; Bell \nExpressVu , at para.  31; Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) , \n2002 SCC 3, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at para.  28). Here, this means that there is no obstacle \nto considering the purpose next in the analysis, and I will look  at the context later. In \nmy view, consideration of the purpose of s.  495(3) Cr. C. is of significant assistance in \nresolving the ambiguity regarding the scope of the provision, and it helpfully informs \nthe analysis.  \n[102]  As I noted above, following the release  of the Ouimet Report , Parliament \nenacted the Bail Reform Act , one of the objectives of which was to reduce unnecessary \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n pre-trial arrest without warrant and detention. This objective is reflected particularly in \ns. 495(2) Cr. C., whose purpose is — I repea t — to impose binding norms that limit \nthe discretion of peace officers to make an arrest without warrant when certain \nconditions are met.  \n[103]  The purpose of s.  495(3) Cr. C., for its part, is complementary to that of \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. Section 495(3) Cr. C. provides some protection to peace officers in \nsituations where, in good faith, they have made a mistake in judgment by arresting a \nperson contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. For example, s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. prevents a peace \nofficer from being held criminally liable for an offence under the Criminal Code  for \nhaving breached the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C., whereas — again by way of \nexample — s. 495(3)(b) Cr. C. limits",

C., whereas — again by way of \nexample — s. 495(3)(b) Cr. C. limits the possibility of a peace officer being held liable \nfor such a contravention in a civil suit. T his possibility is limited by the wording of \ns. 495(3)(b), which confirms that the onus is on the person alleging that his or her arrest \nwas contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. to prove this fact.  \n[104]  While they must be considered with caution, the parliamentary deba tes \nsurrounding the enactment of s.  495(3) Cr. C. that I reproduced at the outset are of \nparticular importance in this case ( Németh v. Canada (Justice) , 2010 SCC 56, [2010] \n3 S.C.R. 281, at para.  46; Reference re Firearms Act (Can.) , 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 \nS.C.R. 783, at para.  17). The same is true of the parliamentary debates that I will \nreproduce below ( Reference re Impact Assessment Act , 2023 SCC 23, at para.  62; R. v. \nAppulonappa , 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para.  64; Application under \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re) , 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para.  37; R. \nv. Gladue , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para.  45). \n[105]  Indeed, in the absence of an especially instructive legislative history (the \nprovisions in question having hardly been amended since their enactment), the \nparliamentary debates provide relevant and reliable information concerning the \npurpose of the former s.  450(3) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(3) Cr. C.) and the intention \nof Parliament. In addition, they offer helpful guidance for the inte rpretation of s.  495(2) \nand s.  495(3) Cr. C. because they reveal how these two provisions interact. I will \ntherefore reproduce the key passages from these debates below to assist in analyzing \nthe purpose of s.  495(3) Cr. C. \n[106]  I note that, before the Standing  Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, \ncertain members raised concerns about s.  495(2) Cr. C. Given that peace officers, in \nthe execution of their duty, are required to exercise their judgment — which is subject \nto human error — and to make decisions in real time, some members of the Committee \nfeared that peace officers would not be adequately pro tected if they made a mistake in \njudgment, even if it was a mistake made in good faith.  \n[107]  Minister Turner responded to those concerns by stating that it was not the \nintention of the legislation to jeopardize the community by discouraging proper and \nefficient  law enforcement by the police ( House of Commons Debates , February 5, 1971, \nat pp.  3116 -17). Quite the opposite. He later added that s.  495(3) Cr. C. was specifically \nintended to give peace officers some protection against such mistakes in judgment. In \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n this regard, the Minister clearly stated that if a peace officer made an arrest when it was \nnot necessary, this would be a mistake in judgment that, under s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C., could \nnot ground a guilty verdict in a criminal proceeding ( Minutes of Proceedings and \nEvidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs , February 23, 1971, \nat pp.  7-9): \nThe second concern of the police was that because the ordinary \npoliceman was going to be required to make this judgment rather than have \nthe judgment made by a desk sergeant or, eventually, a",

C., could \nnot ground a guilty verdict in a criminal proceeding ( Minutes of Proceedings and \nEvidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs , February 23, 1971, \nat pp.  7-9): \nThe second concern of the police was that because the ordinary \npoliceman was going to be required to make this judgment rather than have \nthe judgment made by a desk sergeant or, eventually, a justice of the peace, \nthen there ought to be some protection for the policeman from criminal or \ncivil liability if, in good faith, he makes the wrong judgment . \nIt is clear, first of all, that there was nothing in the fi rst version of the \nbill and nothing in this version of the bill to impose criminal liability on a \npoliceman who happened to make the wrong judgment. If he arrests and it \nlater turns out that, in judgment, he did not need to arrest because the public \nintere st would have been served just as well or better by not arresting, then \nthat is a mistake in judgment for which the policeman will not be penalized \nby criminal liability. He cannot be charged criminally for false arrest.  \n[Emphasis added.]  \n[108]  The Minister reco nfirmed this interpretation to be given to the phrase “any \nproceeding under this or any other Act of Parliament” in answer to a question from a \nmember of the Committee ( Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing \nCommittee on Justice and Legal Affa irs, February  23, 1971, at p.  9): \nMr. Marceau:  Yes. In the first version, in clause 436, subparagraph 3, \nthere is express mention of the fact that the .  . . peace officer [h]as no \ncriminal liability. This is not mentioned in the new version of the Bill.  \nMr. Turner (Ottawa -Carleton): Yes, if you read page 7 of the new \nversion of the Bill[, subsection (3), paragraph (a)].  \na) any proceeding under this or any other Act of Parliament and .  . . \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n any other Act of Parliament, this includes the Criminal Code.  \nMr. Mar ceau:  You interpret that as being a protection against any \ncriminal proceedings.  \nMr. Turner (Ottawa -Carleton):  That is correct.  \n[109]  An analysis of the general scheme of the Criminal Code  reinforces the \ninterpretation that Parliament intended s.  450(3)( a) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(3)(a)) to \nact as a shield in criminal proceedings relating to a peace officer’s actions in making \nan arrest. The interaction of this provision with ss.  25 and 247(2) Cr. C. (1970) , \ncorresponding to the current ss.  25 and 279(2) Cr. C., is enlightening.  \n[110]  At the time s.  450(3) was enacted, s.  247(2) provided that everyone who, \n“without lawful authority” (“ sans autorisation légitime ”), confined, imprisoned or \nforcibly seized another person was  guilty of an indictable offence and liable to \nimprisonment for a term of five years. By specifying in s.  450(3)( a) that a peace officer \nacting under s.  450(1) “ is deemed to be acting lawfully  and in the execution of his duty” \n(“est censé agir légalement  et dans l’exercice de ses fonctions ”) for the pu rposes of any \nproceedings under the Criminal Code , Parliament ensured that the peace officer’s \nactions, even if not in compliance with the requirements of s.  450(2), would not be \nconsidered to be a forcible seizure of a person “ without lawful authority ” (“sans \nautorisation légitime ”) within the meaning of s.  247(2).  \n[111]  Similarly, like the current s.  25 Cr. C., apart from a few differences in form, \ns. 25 Cr. C. as it read at the time provided that “[e]very one who is required or \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n authorized by law  to do anything  in the administration or enforcement of the law .  . . \nas a peace officer or public officer .  . . is, if he acts on reasonable .  .",

C. was to protect, first and foremost, the peace officer who made an arr est without \nwarrant contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C., as well as any person responsible for that officer. \nThis protection was directed in particular at proceedings in which they could be found \ncriminally liable for non -compliance with s.  495(2) Cr. C. Read as a whole, the debates \ntherefore do not support the argument that the presumption of lawfulness in s.  495(3) \nCr. C. applied to the arrest  itself, despite what the Crown suggests in this case.  \n[113]  The parliamentary debates surrounding s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. also con firm \nthat s.  495(3) Cr. C. is concerned primarily with the liability of a peace officer and of \nany person responsible for that officer for failure to comply with the requirements of \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. Minister Turner confirmed that while s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. leaves open \nthe possibility of a civil suit against the peace officer who made the arrest contrary to \ns. 495(2) Cr. C. or a person responsible for that officer , s. 495(3)(b) nonetheless \nprovides some protection against the civil liability that might arise from the conduct of \npeace officers. Indeed, this provision was drafted so as to impose on the person arrested \nwithout warrant the burden of proving that the peace officer believed on reasonable \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n grounds that the public interest could be satisfied without ar resting the person and that \nthere was no risk of the person failing to attend court. As Minister Turner explained, \n“an arrested person .  . . must demonstrate that the police did not carry out their new \nduties properly if he is to recover damages against th em in civil proceedings” ( House \nof Commons Debates , February 5, 1971, at p.  3117). The following comments by \nMinister Turner provide a good understanding of the operation of s.  495(3) as a whole:  \nSubsection (3) .  . . says that notwithstanding the failure o f a police officer \nto exercise his discretion properly in accordance with the Bill — you know, \nwe are dealing with human judgments here — if the police officer makes \nthe wrong judgment, he is going to be protected under paragraph (a) from \na criminal suit, as he is now, but he is not protected under paragraph (b) \nfrom a civil suit. All that paragraph (b) says is that he is open to a civil suit \nif he makes a mistake in judgment but the burden of proof is on the person \nwho feels that he has been wronged by the  exercise of that judgment.  \nSo the ultimate sanction is a civil suit  and .  . . I believe that the police \nof this country, if they accept this Bill as I believe they will be, and I am \ntrying to listen to their objections both at the brotherhood level, and t he \nassociation level, and the chiefs of police level — I think .  . . they will try \nto live within its sphere.

However, when \nhe explained the mechanism of s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. , the Minister referred at all times to \nthe lawfulness of the peace officer’s conduct, in a context where the civil or criminal \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n liabil ity of the officer or of persons responsible for the officer was sought for actions \nrelated to the arrest, and not to the lawfulness of the arrest itself.  \n[115]  I pause to clarify that there is no basis for saying that the purpose of \ns. 495(3) Cr. C.  is to “disc ourage persons resisting arrest where they believe they will \nnot be convicted of the offence for which they are being arrested”, as the Saskatchewan \nCourt of Appeal stated in R. v. Munson , 2003 SKCA 28, 172 C.C.C. (3d) 515, at \npara.  58. That court relied i n part on Adams , McKibbon  and Fuhr , which I discuss at \nthe very beginning of these reasons, in support of its conclusion (see also Jowett Work , \nat paras.  33-34). With respect, such a purpose is not apparent at any point from the \nparliamentary debates we ha ve considered or from any contextual element relevant to \nestablishing the purpose of the provision. It follows from the foregoing that the purpose \nunderlying the enactment of s.  495(3) Cr. C. is not physical  protection (i.e., when the \nperson being arrested  resists arrest by force), but rather legal  protection (i.e., in the \ncontext of a lawsuit or prosecution).  \n[116]  In this context, it can be inferred from s.  495(3)(a) and s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C., \nread as a whole, that they share the same purpose, namely to provide p eace officers and \nany person responsible for them with some protection against proceedings in which \nthey face criminal or civil liability for an arrest contrary to s.  495(2).  \n(3) Context  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n [117]  Other contextual elements also support this interpretation. First, I look at \nthe broader context by discussing the legislative landscape at the time s.  495(3) Cr. C. \nwas enacted, and thus before the advent of the Charter . Second, I consider its \nimmediate c ontext, and specifically the relationship between s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) \nCr. C. \n(a) Pre-Charter  Context Surrounding the Enactment of Section 495(3) Cr.  C. \n[118]  The legislative landscape in which Parliament enacted s.  495(3) Cr. C. is \nan important contextual elemen t. I note that this provision was enacted several years \nbefore the Charter  came into force. It is therefore necessary to place s.  495(3) Cr. C. \nin the context of the time in order to interpret it properly. Ultimately, as we will see, \nthe interpretation to be given to this provision was not disturbed by the advent of the \nCharter . \n[119]  When Parliament enacted s.  450(2) and (3) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(2) \nand (3) Cr. C.) through the Bail Reform Act , the possibilities for accused persons to \nchallenge the lawfulness  of their arrest and obtain redress in their own criminal and \npenal proceedings were very limited. This was due in part to Wray . \n[120]  In June 1970, shortly before the Bail Reform Act came into force, this Court \naffirmed in Wray  that a court did not have the dis cretion to exclude admissible evidence \nsimply because its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, \nfor example",

A court did of course have the  power to exclude evidence obtained \nfollowing an unlawful arrest, but, as Martland  J. explained, the threshold was very high: \n“It is only the allowance of evidence gravely prejudicial to the accused, the \nadmissibility of which is tenuous, and whose probati ve force in relation to the main \nissue before the court is trifling, which can be said to operate unfairly” (p.  293). The \nstate of the law as set out in Wray  seems to have remain unchanged until the advent of \nthe Charter in 1982 (Coughlan, at pp.  429-30). \n[121]  Thus, at the time the first iteration of s.  450(3)  Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(3) \nCr. C.) was enacted, Parliament could not have imagined that, years later, accused \npersons would be able, in their own criminal trial, to challenge infringements of their \nconst itutional rights — such as the right not to be arbitrarily detained — by asserting \nthe unlawfulness of their arrest and seeking the exclusion of the evidence obtained in \nviolation of those rights. The Charter  had not yet been enacted and, even more to the \npoint, this Court had obviously not recognized that an unlawful  arrest could amount to \nan arbitrary  arrest. Nor could Parliament have anticipated that, where a Charter  \ninfringement was established, accused persons would be able to seek other “appropriate \nand just” remedies under s.  24(1) of the  Charter  in their criminal trial, such as a \nsentence reduction or a stay of proceedings. It is accordingly very difficult, if no t \nimpossible, to ascribe to Parliament any intention, in enacting the former s.  450(3) \nCr. C. (1970) , of insulating an arrest contrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. from scrutiny based \non the unlawfulness of the arrest at the time it enacted the provisions in questi on. I \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n \n therefore agree with the respondent that the wording of the former s.  450(3) Cr. C. \n(1970)  (now s.  495(3) Cr. C.) must be interpreted in light of this reality.  \n[122]  Very recently, in Telus , I endorsed the theoretical framework outlined by \nmy colleague Mor eau J. regarding the manner in which legislation should be \ninterpreted in response to changing circumstances (para.  155). It is understood that the \nmodern approach allows courts “[to] appl[y] statutes to new or evolving circumstances” \n(para.  33; see also Interpretation Act , s. 10). It is also possible for Parliament to use \n“broad or open -textured language to cover circumstances that are neither in existence \nnor in [its] contemplation” ( Telus , at para.  33, citing R. v. D.L.W. , 2016 SCC 22, [2016] \n1 S.C.R. 40 2, at para.  61, Perka , at p. 265, and Côté and Devinat, at para.  285), as might \nbe the case with the words “any proceedings” (“ toutes procédures ”) used in s.  495(3) \nCr. C. \n[123]  However, determining whether a provision is capable of applying to new \ncircumstances  is an interpretive question, and it must be answered by reading the text \nof the statute in its context and in a manner consistent with the legislature’s purpose \n(Telus , at para  36). Thus, even where the text of the provision is drafted in general terms \nsuggesting that it could apply to new circumstances, courts must avoid giving it a \nmeaning that would overreach the provision’s purpose. Otherwise, courts risk \nex",

Thus, even where the text of the provision is drafted in general terms \nsuggesting that it could apply to new circumstances, courts must avoid giving it a \nmeaning that would overreach the provision’s purpose. Otherwise, courts risk \nexceeding their institutional role by intruding into questions that can be better \naddressed by leg islatures (Sullivan, at §  6.01[3]).  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n [124]  Moreover, a provision that uses broad and general language can be read \nmore narrowly so that its interpretation does not overreach its purpose. R. v. Kuldip , \n[1990] 3 S.C.R. 618, provides an example of this. In that case , this Court was called \nupon to interpret the words of s.  5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.  C-5. \nRelying on wording that was broader and more general, the accused proposed an \ninterpretation of the provision that would overreach its purpose ( see Sullivan, at \n§ 9.04[4]: “.  . . the guarantee sought by the accused (protection against impeachment \nof credibility) was not rationally related to the purpose  of the provision (protection \nagainst self -incrimination)” (emphasis added)). This Court rejecte d the accused’s \narguments, thereby declining to adopt an interpretation of the provision that, while \nconsistent with the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words, “would extend \nbeyond the purpose” of the provision ( Kuldip , at p.  639). Rather, the Cour t found that \n“the protection offered by s.  5(2) .  . . must be interpreted in consideration of the express \npurpose” — without going beyond it (p.  639).  \n[125]  In light of the foregoing, I find it difficult to draw any definitive \nconclusions from the broad and gene ral wording of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C., especially since \nthe consequences of such drafting were hard to foresee at the time the predecessors to \ns. 495(3)(a) and (b) were enacted. The mere fact that the text is framed in general terms \nis not a basis for conclud ing that Parliament necessarily intended to include \n[TRANSLATION ] “all criminal proceedings” (“ toutes les procédures criminelles ”) \nimaginable within the scope of s.  495(3)(a) (A.F., at para.  71). The same could also be \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n said of the interpretation to be give n to the expression “any other proceedings” in \ns. 495(3)(b) Cr. C. \n[126]  I therefore propose, following the example of Kuldip , to adopt an \ninterpretation of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. that is consistent with but does not overreach the \npurpose of this provision, in othe r words, that applies only to proceedings under the \nCriminal Code  or any other Act of Parliament in which a peace officer or any person \nresponsible for that officer is actually facing liability for a breach of the requirements \nof s. 495(2) Cr. C. \n(b) The Purpo se of Section 495(2) Cr.  C. Is Consistent With an Interpretation \nof Section 495(3) Cr.  C. Limited to the Liability of the Peace Officer and \nof Any Person Responsible for That Officer  \n[127]  The final contextual element that I propose to examine in support of my \nanalysis is the relationship between s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) Cr. C. Given that s.  495(3) \nCr. C. refers directly to s.  495(2) Cr. C., it is necessary to consider it.  \n[128]  As I have already said, the structure of s.  495 Cr. C. confirms that s.  495(2) \nmust be inter preted as a binding limitation, which narrows the scope of the discretion \nconferred by s.  495(1).

In my view, this same structure also confirms that s.  495(3) \nCr. C. must be viewed as providing some protection to peace officers, their employer \nor any other  person who might be held liable for a peace officer’s failure to comply \nwith s.  495(2) Cr. C. \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n \n [129]  Section 495(3) Cr. C. is under the heading “Consequences of arrest without \nwarrant” (“ Conséquences de l’arrestation sans mandat ”). While this marginal note is \nnot part of the content of the provision ( Interpretation Act , s. 14), it may suggest that \ns. 495(3) specifically concerns the “Consequences” (“ Conséquences ”) to be suffered \nby a peace officer who has contravened s.  495 (2) Cr. C. and by the officer’s principal, \namong others.  \n[130]  Focusing on the words “a peace officer .  . . deemed to be acting lawfully \nand in the execution of his duty for the purposes of” (“ l’agent de la paix .  . . censé agir \nlégalement et dans l’exercice de ses foncti ons aux fins ”) makes it clear that s.  495(3) \nCr. C. has the effect of creating a presumption to the effect that, in a proceeding relating \nto the conduct of a peace officer who breached the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C., the \npeace officer is presumed to have acted lawfully as long as he or she acted in \ncompliance with s.  495(1) Cr. C., regardless of his or her failure to comply with the \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. On the other hand, s.  495 Cr. C. does not create any \npresumption with respect to the la wfulness of the arrest without warrant itself. The \nlawfulness of the arrest can always be challenged, even in a criminal proceeding like \nthe trial of the respondent in this case.  \n[131]  Such an interpretation is in keeping with the binding nature of s.  495(2) \nCr. C. Indeed, to interpret s.  495(3) Cr. C. as having the effect of shielding arrests  \ncontrary to s.  495(2) Cr. C. from any finding of unlawfulness would undercut the \nbinding nature of this provision. It would also run directly counter to Parliament’s \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n \n object ive in enacting the Bail Reform Act , that is, to reduce unnecessary arrests without \nwarrant. In other words, the more  broadly s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. is interpreted, the more \nthe normative import of s.  495(2) Cr. C. is eroded, thereby jeopardizing the \nachievem ent of the objective sought by Parliament. It is therefore essential to avoid \nadopting such an interpretation and to opt instead for a proper balancing consistent with \nthe text, context and purpose of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. \n[132]  In the same spirit, I cannot agree with the way in which several appellate \ncourts have interpreted the interaction between s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) to establish the \nscope of s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. (see, among others, Veen  (C.A.), at para.  57). For example, \nthe British Columbia Court of Appeal w rote the following in Jowett Work  about the \nrelationship between s.  495(2) and s.  495(3) Cr. C.: \n. . . s. 495(3)(a) was intended to ensure that the requirements of s.  495(1) \nremained the focus of the power to arrest without warrant, whereas \ns. 495(3)(b) wa s intended to permit the public interest considerations to be \nchallenged in proceedings in the civil or provincial regulatory context.  \n",

[paras.  38-39] \n[133]  With respect, I believe that such an interpretation fails to consider the \nbinding nature of s.  495(2) Cr. C. It also takes away a large part of the provision’s \npractical utility in reducing unnecessary arrests, which was Parliam ent’s objective \nwhen enacting it. On this point, I wholly agree with the sentiment expressed by \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n \n Kopstein Prov.  Ct. J. in R. v. Prince  (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 73 (Man.), when he stated \nthe following:  \n. . . it would seem a strange phenomenon for Parliament to  have taken the \ninitiative to enact s.  450(2) which restricts the power of arrest without a \nwarrant for those offences referred to in s.  450(2), and then immediately \nthereafter by s -s. (3) to nullify any legal or practical effect which might \narise out of t he operation of s -s (2). [p.  80] \n[134]  It is true, as noted by the attorneys general of Ontario and Alberta, that the \ncombined operation of s.  495(2) and s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C. (civil action in damages) also \nserves to change peace officers’ conduct to some extent b y encouraging them to comply \nwith the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C., on pain of being sued civilly (s.  495(3)(b) \nCr. C.) for non -compliance with s.  495(2) Cr. C. The experience of provinces like \nOntario and Alberta shows that complainants have been able  to allege the unlawfulness \nof an arrest in a civil proceeding and to claim damages as a remedy. The Attorney \nGeneral of Ontario cites, for example, Collins , in which the complainant alleged that \nhis arrest was unlawful because it was contrary to s.  495(2)  Cr. C. and that his right \nguaranteed by s.  9 of the Charter  had been infringed. This is in line with Minister \nTurner’s statement that “the ultimate sanction is a civil suit” ( Minutes of Proceedings \nand Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Leg al Affairs , March  4, 1971, \nat p. 14; see also pp.  10-11). In this sense, I concede that it would be going too far to \nsay that the interpretation suggested by the Crown would completely deprive s.  495(2) \nCr. C. of any useful effect.  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n [135]  That being the case, it must be recognized that an interpretation whereby \nan arrest contrary to s.  495(2)  Cr. C. would still be considered lawful in criminal and \npenal proceedings, such as the trial of the respondent in this case, would greatly \ndiminish the deterrent effect of th is imperative, such that Parliament’s objective would \nbe not only largely exceeded but also, and above all, compromised. This interpretation \nmust therefore be rejected.  \n(4) Conclusion on the Interpretation of Section 495(3) Cr. C. \n[136]  In conclusion, s.  495(3) Cr.

C. \n[136]  In conclusion, s.  495(3) Cr. C. is intended to govern the liability of peace \nofficers for failure to comply with the requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. Since peace \nofficers are called upon to exercise their judgment quickly to make an arrest without \nwarrant in circumstances that are  often unpredictable, it was necessary for Parliament \nto establish some protection in relation to the then new limitation on their discretion \nintroduced by s.  495(2) Cr. C. \n[137]  From this perspective, s.  495(3)(a) Cr. C. provides peace officers or any \nperson re sponsible for them with greater protection when proceedings are brought \nagainst them under the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament by creating a \npresumption that peace officers are deemed to have acted lawfully and in the execution \nof their duty. As for s.  495(3)(b) Cr. C., it sets out the parameters for a civil suit that \nmay be brought by a person who believes that his or her arrest was contrary to s.  495(2) \nCr. C. For the purposes of such a lawsuit, the peace officer is presumed to have acted \nlawfully and in the execution of his or her duty unless the person arrested without \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n warrant successfully demonstrates that the arrest was contrary to the requirements \nestablished by s.  495(2) Cr. C. Section 495(3)(b) therefore ensures that, in a civil suit \nagainst the peace officer or any person responsible for that officer for a contravention \nof s. 495(2), the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.  \n[138]  I would add that such an interpretation is consistent with the Criminal \nCode ’s special nature, which requires that  it be read having regard “to liberty interests” \n(R. v. McIntosh , [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para.  39). Along the same lines, I noted in \nKosoian v. Société de transport de Montréal , 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, that \n“[i]n a free and democratic society, p olice officers may interfere with the exercise of \nindividual freedoms only to the extent provided for by law” (para.  6). Of course, this \ntaking into account of individual freedoms must not compromise other fundamental \ncriminal law considerations, which mus t be carefully balanced with these freedoms — \nincluding public safety and the public interest in ensuring that peace officers can do \ntheir work effectively and expeditiously (see CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada \n(Attorney General) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743,  at para.  20). \n[139]  That being the case, as we have seen, Parliament’s intention in enacting \ns. 450(2) and (3) Cr. C. (1970)  (now s.  495(2) and (3) Cr. C.) was precisely to balance \nthese various considerations. I therefore propose to give full effect to the bal ancing \ndone by our elected representatives. In this context, preference should be given to the \ninterpretation that best reflects this desired balance, without overstepping it.  \n Application to the Facts  \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n [140]  In light of the above interpretation, I would dismiss t he appeal and uphold \nthe order that the respondent be given a new trial. However, my reasons for reaching \nthis result differ from those of the Quebec Court of Appeal. With great respect, let me \nmake myself clear.  \n[141]  Section 495(3) Cr. C. creates a presumption  of lawfulness applicable to the \nconduct of a peace officer who has made an arrest without warrant that does not meet \nthe requirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. Section 495(3)(b) provides, however, for the \npossibility of rebutting this presumption in a proceedin g not brought under the Criminal \nCode  or any other Act of Parliament, where the person alleging the unlawfulness of the \npeace officer’s conduct establishes that the officer did not comply with the \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr.

Section 495(3)(b) provides, however, for the \npossibility of rebutting this presumption in a proceedin g not brought under the Criminal \nCode  or any other Act of Parliament, where the person alleging the unlawfulness of the \npeace officer’s conduct establishes that the officer did not comply with the \nrequirements of s.  495(2) Cr. C. The Court of Appeal’s erro r was in finding that the \npossibility of rebutting the presumption of lawfulness applied in a proceeding under \nthe Criminal Code or another Act of Parliament contemplated by s.  495(3)(a), which \ndistorted its entire interpretation.  \n[142]  Thus, by stating that in this case s.  495(3) Cr. C. guaranteed the respondent \n“the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the arrest upon allegation and proof” \n(C.A. reasons, at para.  18), the Court of Appeal erred, because in the context of \ndetermining the criminal liability of the respondent in this case — and not that of the \npeace officer — there was no presumption of lawfulness that applied.  \n[143]  On this point, I agree with the analysis of the Alberta Court of Appeal in \nVeen  to the effect that “sections 495(3)(a) and (b) were in tended to operate differently \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n and in different contexts, with subsection (a) applying to criminal matters and (b) \napplying to civil matters” (para.  59). It follows that the phrase “unless in any such \nproceedings it is alleged and established by the person making the allegation that the \npeace officer did not comply with the requirements of subsection (2)” in s.  495(3)(b) \nCr. C., as the very structure of subs.  (3) clearly indicates, applies only to para.  (b), and \nits application cannot be extended to the enti re subsection. There is no justification for \nreading into para.  (a), as the Court of Appeal did, a phrase that is expressly confined to \npara.  (b). \n[144]  In summary, since the criminal proceeding brought against the respondent \n— specifically a charge for sexual a ssault — does not fall within either of the \nparagraphs of s.  495(3), the Quebec Court of Appeal could not base its analysis on this \nprovision. That being said, I am of the view that this error by the Court of Appeal is \nnot determinative. In this case, it i s rather the trial judge’s refusal to hold the voir dire  \nrequested by the respondent that constitutes a reviewable error.  \n[145]  Section 495(2) Cr. C. is mandatory and binding. Failure to comply with it \nmay make an arrest without warrant unlawful, even if the arr est meets the requirements \nof s. 495(1) Cr. C. An arrest that is unlawful may, by that very fact, be characterized as \narbitrary within the meaning of s.  9 of the Charter  and thus provide a basis for \nconstitutional remedies under s.  24 of the Charter . \n[146]  This case does not involve any of the scenarios in which s.  495(3) applies, \nbecause the criminal or civil liability of the peace officer who arrested the respondent \n2025 SCC 43 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n without warrant or of any person responsible for that officer is not in issue. The \npresumption o f lawfulness created by s.  495(3) Cr. C. with respect to the conduct of \nthe peace officer who made the arrest therefore does not apply, and the trial court had \nto hold a voir dire  to determine the lawfulness of that arrest. The refusal to conduct that \nhearing is a reviewable error that warrants a new trial.  \nV. Conclusion  \n[147]  For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the order for a \nnew trial made by the Court of Appeal.  \n Appeal dismissed.  \n Solicitor  for the appellant: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions , \nMontréal.  \n Solicitors for the responde nt: Battista Turcot Israel, Montréal; Les avocats \nPoupart, Touma, Montréal . \n Solicitor for the intervener Attorney General of Ontario: Crown Law \nOffice  — Criminal , Toronto.  \n Solicitor for the intervener Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Crown \nProsecution Service  — Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office , Calgary.  \n2025",
