He alleged that they failed to make \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n timely disclosure of the pit wall instability and rockslide, contrary to their obligations \nunder the Securities Act , since the pit wall instability and rockslide each resulted in a \n“material change”, as defined in s.  1(1) of the Securities Act , in the company’s \n“business, operations or capital” that should have been disclosed “forthwith” under \ns. 75(1) of the Securities Act . The investor brought a motion under s.  138.8(1) of the \nSecurities Act  for leave to pursue the statutory cause of action, and also moved for \ncertification of the proposed class proceeding.  \n The motion judge refused to grant leave for the investor to pursue the \nstatutory cause of action and accordingly dismissed the motion fo r class certification. \nHe concluded that since the mining company continued its business and operations as \na mining company, there was no reasonable possibility that the investor could establish \nthat either the pit wall instability or the rockslide resulte d in a “material change” in the \nmining company’s affairs requiring immediate disclosure. He held that neither \ndevelopment resulted in a change in the mining company’s business, operations or \ncapital. The Court of Appeal allowed the investor’s appeal, grant ing him leave to \nproceed with the statutory cause of action but referring issues regarding the certification \nof the class proceeding back to the lower court. It held that based on a more generous \ninterpretation of the words “change in the business, operati ons or capital”, there was a \nreasonable possibility that the pit wall instability and rockslide involved changes in the \nmining company’s operations, given the undisputed evidence that the developments \nimpacted the company’s phasing of the mine and reduced its next annual production \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n forecast. Consequently, the investor had advanced a plausible interpretation and \nsufficient evidence to support granting leave.  \n Held (Côté J. dissenting) : The appeal should be dismissed.  \n Per Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal , \nO’Bonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The motion judge erred by relying on restrictive \ndefinitions of “change”, “business”, “operations” and “capital”, and then by applying \nthose definitions to determine whether there was a reasonable possibil ity that there had \nbeen a material change. The Ontario legislature intentionally left these terms undefined \nto allow the legislation to be applied flexibly and contextually to a wide range of \nindustries and corporate structures. Moreover, the test for leav e under s.  138.8(1) of the \nSecurities Act  requires a plausible analysis of the applicable legislative provisions and \nsome credible evidence in support of the claim. A plausible analysis is not a plausible \nstatutory interpretation, but rather a plausible application of the legislation to the facts . \nThe uncontested evidence in the instant case was that the pit wall instability and \nrockslide impacted the company’s operations at its mine. Accordingly, a plausible \nanalysis of the applicable legislative provisions and evidence on the motion showed a \nreasonable or realistic chance that the action could succeed; as a result, the investor \nshould have been granted leave to commence an action for the alleged breach of the \nmining company’s timely disclosure obligations.  \n Section 1(1) of the Securities Act defines a “material fact” as “a fact that \nwould reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n of the securities”. It also defines a “material change”, in subcl.  (a)(i) of the definition, \nas “a change in the business, operatio ns or capital of the issuer that would reasonably \nbe expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of any of the \nsecurities of the issuer”. Under the Securities Act , material facts need only be disclosed \nperiodically, while material ch anges must be disclosed immediately, or in the words of \ns. 75(1), “forthwith”. This imposes an obligation on issuers to make timely disclosure \nof material changes.

    "text": " \nsecurities of the issuer”. Under the Securities Act , material facts need only be disclosed \nperiodically, while material ch anges must be disclosed immediately, or in the words of \ns. 75(1), “forthwith”. This imposes an obligation on issuers to make timely disclosure \nof material changes. Proper disclosure is the heart and soul of the securities regulations \nacross Canada and is p ivotal for an effective securities regime. Disclosure helps \nmaintain a level playing field of information between investors and issuers, and \npreventing and deterring informational asymmetry between investors and issuers is \nessential to the integrity of the  securities system and the public interest. Disclosure also \npromotes the efficiency of capital markets by helping investors to identify and direct \ncapital to the most deserving public companies.  \n The distinction between a “material fact” and a “material ch ange” must be \nresolved under the modern principle of statutory interpretation. A statutory provision \nis interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose to find a meaning that is \nharmonious with the legislation as a whole. Under the Securities Act , mate rial changes \nare distinct from the broader category of material facts. A material fact is static, because \nit provides a snapshot of an issuer’s affairs at a particular point in time, whereas a \nmaterial change is dynamic, because it necessarily compares an issuer’s affairs at two \npoints in time. For a material change to occur, there must be a change, as opposed to \nthe existence of a fact. Moreover, material changes are related to changes in the issuer’s \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n business, operations or capital, they must be internal rather than external to the issuer, \nand they usually involve more than mere negotiations or internal deliberations. Like \nmaterial facts, however, material changes must be reasonably expected to have a \nsignificant effect on the market price or value of secu rities. There are two main policy \nreasons for the distinction between a material fact and a material change: (1)  it balances \nthe burden that disclosure places on issuers with the need for investors to be informed \non a timely basis of material developments in an issuer’s affairs; and (2) it promotes \nthe purpose of securities law to remedy informational asymmetry between issuers and \ninvestors.  \n  The term “change”, which is not defined in the Securities Act , should not \nbe interpreted restrictively. The inheren t flexibility of what can be a “change” suggests \nthat the ordinary meaning of the term should not be constrained by dictionary \ndefinitions. Substituting a dictionary definition for the intentionally undefined term \n“change” restricts the reach of the legisl ation, contrary to the legislature’s purpose. The \nOntario legislature’s intentional decision to leave the word “change” undefined and to \nuse that term with a group of other undefined words has several consequences. First, \nthe legislature intended the word “change” to retain its ordinary meaning. Second, the \nword “change” takes meaning from the particular context of securities legislation, \nwhere the purpose of continuous disclosure obligations is to level the informational \nplaying field between issuers and i nvestors. Third, by leaving the term “change” \nundefined, the legislature has maintained flexibility for the Securities Act  to apply to \nwide ly varying  factual scenarios. Finally, although the legislature left “change” \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n undefined, regulators and courts have p rovided helpful interpretive guidance on what \nconstitutes a “material change” in various policy documents and judicial decisions.  \n A development does not need to be important or substantial to constitute a \nchange. The magnitude or significance of a develop ment in an issuer’s affairs is \ntherefore not to be imported as a consideration for whether it constitutes a change. The \nundefined term “change” does not include qualifiers such as core, fundamental, or key. \nEvaluating the nature of the change is qualitativ e, while considering the magnitude of \nthe change or whether it is significant is a question of materiality. While a narrower \ndisclosure standard has developed in the jurisprudence and provides that a change must \nbe important and substantial to need to be d isclosed immediately, this narrower \nstandard is inconsistent with the text of the legislation, which simply refers to a \n“change”, and is mistaken as a matter of doctrine and policy.  \n Similarly, the undefined terms appearing in the phrase “business, \noperati ons or capital” should not be interpreted restrictively. Not only are the terms not \ndefined in the Securities Act , they are also not defined in the leading judicial decisions, \nregulatory decisions, securities law textbooks or in the key regulatory instrume nts or \npolicy",

Not only are the terms not \ndefined in the Securities Act , they are also not defined in the leading judicial decisions, \nregulatory decisions, securities law textbooks or in the key regulatory instrume nts or \npolicy statements. The legislature left these terms undefined for several reasons. First, \nthe Securities Act  relies on the ordinary commercial meaning of these widely \nunderstood commercial concepts, rather than creating rigid statutory definitions. \nSecond, leaving the terms undefined allows courts and regulators to apply the \nlegislation as broadly and flexibly as the context and circumstances require. Finally, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n the phrase “change in the business, operations or capital” is a holistic standard to be \napplied, rather than a requirement to parse each element separately.  \n Whether there has been a material change in a given case is a highly \ncontextual question of mixed fact and law. While disclosure decisions are a matter of \nlegal obligation, there is no brig ht line test and the determination is a matter of judgment \nand common sense applied to the unique circumstances of each case. The contextual \nexercise of identifying a material change is guided by the purpose of disclosure \nobligations to level informational  asymmetry between issuers and investors, which \nserves to maintain the integrity of the securities system and protect the public interest.  \n Pursuant to s.  138.8(1) of the Securities Act , a plaintiff must obtain leave \nof a court to commence an action for br each of timely disclosure obligations under the \nSecurities Act . The test for leave in s.  138.8(1) provides that the court should grant \nleave only where it is satisfied that “the action is being brought in good faith” and “there \nis a reasonable possibility that the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the \nplaintiff”. It is a preliminary merits test, but does not require proof on a balance of \nprobabilities that the action will succeed at trial. The test is, however, more stringent \nthan the test for a uthorization or certification of a class action. It is a threshold screening \nmechanism intended to deter meritless litigation brought to coerce unjust settlements. \nThe plaintiff must establish a reasonable or realistic chance, and not merely a \npossibility,  that the action will succeed at trial, based on a plausible analysis of the \napplicable legislative provisions and some credible evidence in support of the claim. A \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n \n plausible analysis of the applicable legislative provisions is not simply a plausible \ninterpretation of those provisions. On a motion for leave, the interpretation of the \nprovisions at issue must still be correct. Statutory interpretation is not conducted less \nstringently or in a more relaxed fashion than at a trial on the merits. The plaintiff must \nshow a plausible application of the relevant legislative provisions, based on the limited \nevidence available at this early stage of the proceedings.  \n Per Côté J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the judgment of \nthe Court of Appeal set aside , and the motion judge’s order dismissing the investor’s \nmotion for leave restored. The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the investor \ncould satisfy the leave requirement. With the proper interpretation of “material \nchange”, the investor would not b e able to satisfy the court that he had a reasonable \npossibility of successfully establishing at trial that the pit wall instability or rock slide \nconstituted a change in the mining company’s business, operations, or capital.  \n A “material change” is a chan ge in the core or high -level aspects of the \nissuer’s business, operations, or capital. In drawing the distinction it did between \n“material fact” and “material change”, the legislature intended to oblige issuers to \nassess only changes that alter the nature of their business, operations, or capital, \nunderstood at a high level of generality, for materiality and potential disclosure.  Four \nprinciples have emerged from the common law for circumscribing the meaning of “a \nchange in the business, operations or capit al of the issuer”. They consist of four \nexclusions for events affecting an issuer that do not come within the definition of \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n “change” such that, even if the events in question may reasonably be expected to have \na significant effect on an issuer’s share pric e, they do not require immediate",

They consist of four \nexclusions for events affecting an issuer that do not come within the definition of \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n “change” such that, even if the events in question may reasonably be expected to have \na significant effect on an issuer’s share pric e, they do not require immediate disclosure. \nThe first type is external facts or changes beyond the control of an issuer. These cannot \nconstitute a material change unless they actually result in a change in an issuer’s \nbusiness , operations or capital. The second type is simple fluctuations in revenue or \nproduction. Even explained changes in results that do not stem from alterations in an \nissuer’s business, operations, or capital can fall outside the category of “material \nchange”. The third type is uncertain  developments in an issuer’s business, operations \nor capital, such as moving through interim stages of a merger negotiation, having new \ndiscussions relating to an acquisition, or responding to a take -over bid. The fourth type \nis events that maintain the st atus quo of an issuer.  \n An ordinary reading of the text of the definition of “material change” in \ns. 1(1) of the Securities Act  indicates, and the context and purpose strongly support, \nthat only changes to high -level or core elements of an issuer constitute a change in its \n“business, operations or capital”. The text of the provision and the constituents of \nimmediate context suppor t this interpretation. The meaning of “change” must be \nunderstood in relation to the terms it acts upon, namely, “business, operations or \ncapital”. Those words are to be interpreted in accordance with the “associated words” \nrule of statutory interpretation  that takes the surrounding terms into account. \nConsidered as a group, the words all suggest a high level of generality and all relate to \nthe core aspects of an issuer. The textual emphasis on high -level alterations is also \nsignalled in subcl.  (a)(ii) of t he definition of “material change”, that defines the term \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n “material change” to also mean “a decision to implement a change referred to in \nsubclause (i) made by the board of directors or other persons acting in a similar capacity \nor by senior management of the issuer”. This strongly suggests that a “change” under \nboth subclauses excludes minor alterations in the affairs of the issuer that are beneath \nthe purview of these decision makers and therefore concerns decisions that affect an \nissuer’s business, opera tions, or capital at their core or at a high level.  \n The motion judge’s analysis of the ordinary meaning of the key terms at \nplay in the instant case is accepted. He interpreted the term “change” by adopting its \nordinary and grammatical meaning. He constru ed a “change” as a shift in the issuer’s \ncore aspects that puts it in a different position, or on a different course, or direction. \nHis interpretations of “business”, “operations” and “capital” also accord with the \nlegislature’s focus on understanding thos e terms at a high level of generality, as \nevidenced by both the general words chosen and their association with other terms. In \naddition, the motion judge’s use of the dictionary definition of “change” was no t \nimproper given tha t the definition he found wa s tested against, and supported by, his \nassessment of the purpose of the statute and legislative intent. The motion judge’s \ninterpretation, by linking “change” to “business, operations or capital”, properly \nfocusses on the core aspects or high -level elemen ts of an issuer while excluding \nconsideration of external, production or revenue -oriented, uncertain, routine, or \nordinary developments that do not rise to the level of “changes”.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n  The broader context and purpose of the Securities Act  also support the \nmotion judge’s interpretation. In particular, his interpretation accords with the \nlegislature’s deliberate distinction between “material change” and “material fact”, the \nvarious policy considerations underlying the distinction, and the purposes that underlie \nthe Securities Act ’s disclosure regime. Investor protection and the remedying of \ninformational asymmetry do not exclusively favour a low threshold for disclosure; too \nmuch disclosure can also be prejudicial to investors. Moreover, investor protection does \nnot override the other objectives of the Securities Act .

Investor protection and the remedying of \ninformational asymmetry do not exclusively favour a low threshold for disclosure; too \nmuch disclosure can also be prejudicial to investors. Moreover, investor protection does \nnot override the other objectives of the Securities Act . The legislature chose to impose \nbalanced disclosure obligations on issuers using the distinction between “material fact” \nand “material change”; the importance of this distinction has been repeatedly \nrecognized. In making this distinction, the legislature struck a balance between \nensuring meaningful investor protection and avoiding undue burdens on issuers, \nthereby crafting a disclosure regime with limits. The legislature sought periodic \ndisclosure of a  broad array of information affecting an issuer, and immediate disclosure \nof only a narrower subset of changes.  \n The impacts or consequences of the majority’s overbroad understandings \nof the terms “change”, “business”, “operations” and “capital” will be th at almost every \nevent that affects the affairs of an issuer will have to be reviewed for materiality and \nalmost every analysis of “material change” will become a question of materiality alone. \nIn effect, the words “business, operations or capital” are give n no meaning, the clear \nlegislated distinctions are collapsed, and the regulatory burden is increased in a manner \nthat is not justified by the text, context, and purpose of the Securities Act . It is unclear \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n how the four common law exclusions for events aff ecting an issuer that do not come \nwithin the definition of “change” can survive the expansive definitions adopted by the \nmajority. There is, however, agreement with the majority that it is not desirable to \nattempt to create a bright line test for material change. To decipher whether a “material \nchange” has occurred, the inquiry will always be fact -specific. This preserves the \nflexibility that courts require to consider the unique facts of each case.  \n Overbroad disclosure obligations that conflate “material change” and \n“material fact” run contrary to the Securities Act ’s delicate policy considerations and \nhave practical consequences. Specifically, the conflation may encourage \nover-disclosure or premature disclosure beyond what is required by the statute, carr ying \nwith it an increased regulatory burden and risks to the efficiency of capital markets. \nThe impact may incentivize issuers to over -disclose or disclose prematurely to mitigate \ncompliance and liability risk. This presents at least two concerns for inves tors. First, \nthis market noise may very well prevent investors from assessing the true character and \nactivities of an issuer, valuing its securities, and making informed investment decisions, \nresulting in increased costs in corporate transactions. Second, over-disclosure or \npremature disclosure may also frustrate the goal of directing capital to the most \ndeserving issuers, which may stunt efficiency and the allocation of capital within the \nmarket, ultimately reducing overall returns for investors. Issuers w ill also be required \nto undertake internal changes that could prove costly to respond to the majority’s \nupholding of the Court of Appeal’s broad interpretation, as they will also be required \nto assess every event affecting their affairs for materiality. Th is is not practicable, nor \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n is it just when civil liability may follow from a failure to disclose. Finally, the potential \nliability of directors and officers will also be expanded by this broad and undefined \ndisclosure standard, with negative impacts.  \n As for the standard to be met for granting leave to a plaintiff who argues \nthat an issuer has failed to immediately disclose a material change, there is agreement \nwith the majority that the definition of “material change” remains static at all stages of \nlitiga tion. The interpretation of the statute must be correct and does not change based \non the stage of proceedings. There is also agreement with the majority that the \nrequirement in s.  138.8(1)(b) of the Securities Act  that there be “a reasonable possibility \nthat the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff” means that the plaintiff \nmust offer both a plausible analysis of the applicable legislative provisions, and some \ncredible evidence in support of the claim. There is further agreement that the language \n“plausible interpretation” requires that the application of the statute to the available \nevidence be plausible. As a result, the motion judge was correct to apply his own \ninterpretation of the term “material change” rather than leaving the int erpretation open \nfor the parties to settle at trial.  \nCases Cited  \nBy Jamal J.  \n",

Overview  \n[1] This appeal requires the Court to address what has been described as \n“perhaps the most difficult area of sec urities law” — the distinction between a “material \nfact” and a “material change” under the Ontario Securities Act , R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, and \nequivalent legislation across Canada (Ontario Securities Commission, “Consolidation \nof Remarks of Peter J. Dey Conce rning Disclosure Under the Securities Act  Made to \nSecurities Lawyers in Calgary and Toronto on June 7 and 9” (1983), 6 O.S.C. Bull.  \n2361 (“Dey Remarks”), at p. 2361). The appeal also requires the Court to clarify the \ntest under s. 138.8(1) of the Securitie s Act  for leave to commence an action for breach \nof an issuer’s disclosure obligations.  \n[2] A “material fact” is defined under the Securities Act  as “a fact that would \nreasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the \nsecurities” (s. 1(1) (see Appendix)). Material facts need only be disclosed periodically \nunder the legislation. By contrast, a “material change” is defined in relevant part as “a \nchange in the business, operations or capital of the issuer that would reasonably  be \nexpected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of any of the securities \nof the issuer” (s. 1(1)). Material changes must be disclosed immediately, or in the words \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n of the statute, “forthwith” (s. 75(1)), imposing an obligation to make  timely disclosure. \nThe test for leave to commence an action under the Securities Act for breach of an \nissuer’s disclosure obligations provides that the court should grant leave only where it \nis satisfied that “the action is being brought in good faith” an d “there is a reasonable \npossibility that the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff” (s. 138.8(1)).  \n[3] This case arises in the wake of a Canadian mining company detecting pit \nwall instability at its premier mine. Within days, the mine ex perienced a rockslide that \nrequired the company to shut down at least part of the mine for a time and to revise the \nmine’s production forecast downward by 20 percent for the next year. When the \ncompany disclosed these developments to investors about a mont h later, the company’s \nshare price dropped 16  percent within a day, resulting in a loss of over $1  billion in \nmarket capitalization. Soon afterwards, an investor applied for leave to commence an \naction for breach of the company’s timely disclosure obligati ons and for certification \nof a class proceeding.  \n[4] The motion judge at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice accepted that the \npit wall instability and rockslide may have been “material facts”, but ruled that there \nwas no reasonable possibility that the inve stor could establish a “material change” in \nthe company’s “business, operations or capital”. The motion judge relied on a \ndictionary definition of the word “change” as “a different position, course, or direction” \n(2022 ONSC 81, at para. 150, quoting the de finition of “change” in the Merriam -\nWebster Dictionary  (online)), and drew on case law to",

The motion judge relied on a \ndictionary definition of the word “change” as “a different position, course, or direction” \n(2022 ONSC 81, at para. 150, quoting the de finition of “change” in the Merriam -\nWebster Dictionary  (online)), and drew on case law to define the terms “business”, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n “operations”, and “capital”. He ruled that since the company continued its business and \noperations as a mining company, there was no reas onable possibility that either the pit \nwall instability or the rockslide resulted in a “change” in the company’s “business”, \n“operations”, or “capital”. As a result, the company had not been required to disclose \nthe developments “forthwith”. Leave under s.  138.8(1) was therefore denied. The \nmotion judge went on to determine that if there had been a change, then there was a \nreasonable possibility that the change would have been material.  \n[5] The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal. It ruled that the m otion \njudge misinterpreted the statutory test for a “material change” by adopting restrictive \ndefinitions of the terms at issue, which it said “have not yet been definitively interpreted \nin the jurisprudence” (2023 ONCA 359, 166 O.R. (3d) 732 , at para. 7).  The motion \njudge then erred by applying those restrictive definitions to the test for leave, which the \nCourt of Appeal said required only a “plausible interpretation” of the statutory \nprovisions at issue and sufficient evidence to support granting leave. In the Court of \nAppeal’s view, there was a reasonable possibility that the pit wall instability and \nrockslide involved “changes” in the company’s operations, given the undisputed \nevidence that these developments impacted the company’s phasing of the mine a nd \nreduced its next annual production forecast.  \n[6] I would dismiss the appeal. In my view, the motion judge erred by relying \non restrictive definitions of “change”, “business”, “operations”, and “capital”, and then \nerred by applying those definitions to deter mine whether there was a reasonable \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n \n possibility that there had been a material change. The Ontario legislature intentionally \nleft these terms undefined to allow the legislation to be applied flexibly and \ncontextually to a wide range of industries and corpo rate structures. The disclosure \nstandards in the Securities Act should be applied to promote the statutory purpose of \npreventing and deterring informational asymmetry between issuers and investors, while \nrecognizing that the statutory terms at issue acquir e meaning by being applied in \nconcrete factual circumstances. By contrast, adopting rigid definitions would ossify the \nSecurities Act  and would frustrate the statutory purpose.  \n[7] Moreover, as this Court has stated, the test for leave under s. 138.8(1) of \nthe Securities Act  requires a “plausible analysis  of the applicable legislative provisions, \nand some credible evidence in support of the claim”  (Theratechnologies inc. v. 121851 \nCanada inc. , 2015 SCC 18, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 106, at para. 39 (emphasis added), quoted \nin Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Green , 2015 SCC 60, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 801, \nat para. 121). A “plausible analysis” is not a plausible statutory interpretation , but \nrather a plaus ible application  of the legislation to the facts. Statutory interpretation is \nconducted in accordance with the modern principle, both on a motion for leave and at \na trial on the merits. A plausible analysis must, however, show how the legislation \napplies t o the facts by accounting for the limited evidence available on a motion for \nleave, which is brought before there has been documentary production or oral \ndiscovery.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n \n [8] Here, the uncontested evidence on the motion was that the pit wall \ninstability and rockslid e impacted the company’s operations at its mine. Hence, the \nevidence showed that these events could have resulted in a “change”. No one \nchallenges the conclusion of the courts below that there is a reasonable possibility these \nevents could be shown at tria l to be “material”.",

Background  \nA. Lundin Mining Corporation and the Candelaria Mine  \n[9] The appellant, Lundin Mining Corporation, is a federally -incorporated \nCanadian mining company whose shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The \ncompany has operations in different parts of the world and primarily produces copper, \nnickel, and zinc. The individual appellants were officers and directors of Lundin at the \nrelevant times.  \n[10] Lundin held an 80  percent ownership interest in the Candelaria mine in \nChile, which produces copper ore from an open pit mine and three underground mines. \nThe Candelaria min e accounted for between 55  percent and 60  percent of Lundin’s \ntotal sales revenue in 2016 and 2017, with the open pit mine accounting for about \n95 percent of all material mined at Candelaria. In 2017, the Candelaria mine had 19 \nyears left in its lifespan a nd 5 remaining phases, known as Phases 9 to 13. Phase 9 and \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n \n part of Phase 10 were scheduled to be mined in October 2017. Lundin removed 87 \nmillion tonnes of material from the Candelaria open pit mine in 2017.  \nB. Lundin Detects Pit Wall Instability at the Cand elaria Mine and a Rockslide Soon \nFollows  \n[11] On October 25, 2017, Lundin detected pit wall instability at the Candelaria \nopen pit mine. Lundin regularly warned investors of the risks of pit wall instability and \nrockslides, which are common in the mining indust ry. In this instance, the instability \nwas localized and all personnel were evacuated from that area of the mine. There was \nno direct evidence before the court as to whether the rest of the open pit mine or the \nunderground mines were evacuated or shut down.  \n[12] On October 31, 2017, the pit wall instability caused a localized rockslide \nin the open pit mine. About 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of waste material fell down a \nslope, restricting access to Phase 9. This volume of material represented about \n0.8 percent of C andelaria’s 2017 annual production, roughly equivalent to three days \nof mining. The rockslide caused no fatalities, injuries, or damage to equipment. There \nwas no direct evidence before the court of the immediate impact on the mine’s \noperations.  \nC. Lundin Dis closes the Pit Wall Instability and Rockslide to Investors a Month \nLater  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n \n [13] Lundin did not disclose the pit wall instability or rockslide to investors \nimmediately. The company did so about a month later, on November 29, 2017, after \nthe close of trading, as pa rt of a regular news release series providing operational \nupdates. This news release set out an update on the company’s operations for the next \n3 years beginning in 2018 and on its 10 -year guidance for the Candelaria mine.  \n[14] The news release described “recen t instability in a localized area of the \npit’s east wall and a slide which occurred October 31, 2017” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 340). \nAs a result, the company lowered its copper production forecasts at the Candelaria mine \nfor 2018 and 2019. The revised 2018 fo recast was now between 104,000 and 109,000 \ntonnes, down 20  percent from the previous outlook for 2018. In the near -term, Lundin \nplanned to focus on pushing back the waste from the area of the rockslide and to make \nup the lost copper production with ore fro m a low -grade stockpile.

Lundin’s Share Price Drops 16  Percent  \n[15] The next day, on November 30, 2017, Lundin’s share price dropped \n16 percent from the pr evious day’s closing price — representing a loss of more than \n$1 billion in market capitalization.  \n[16] After the close of trading, Lundin released a technical report describing the \nrockslide, the changes to the life of the mine, the future reductions in copper  production, \nand the low -grade stockpile material to be used instead of the higher -grade copper ore.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n \n E. Lundin Hosts a Conference Call with Investors  \n[17] On December 1, 2017, before the market opened and trading resumed, \nLundin hosted a conference call with inves tors and stock analysts to provide an \noperational update and to answer questions. Lundin’s then -chief executive officer \nacknowledged investor concerns about the pit wall instability and rockslide and the \n“big hit” to the company’s stock price the day befor e, which he described as a “black \neye for us” (A.R., vol.  III, at p.  268). He noted that Candelaria’s “localized pit \ninstability” would result in the company being “down on copper for next year, which \nis obviously a concern to a lot of investors and one of  the key elements .  . . resulting in \nour significant stock decline yesterday” (pp.  253-54). He also accepted that the \ncompany “had not communicated well enough” and “apologize[d] for not \ncommunicating more clearly on some of the background behind the inves tments in the \nproduction plan” (pp. 254 and 268). Lundin’s president and managing director added \nthat they “actually had indications that [the rockslide] was going to happen about 5 \ndays prior” (p. 255).  \nF. An Investor Commences a Proposed Class Action for Fa ilure to Make Timely \nDisclosure  \n[18] The respondent, Dov Markowich, is an investor who purchased 10,000 \nshares of Lundin between November 15 and 27, 2017. In January 2018, Mr. Markowich \ncommenced a proposed national class proceeding before the Ontario Superior Court \nagainst Lundin and several of the company’s officers and directors, alleging that they \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n \n had failed to make timely disclosure of the pit wall instability and rockslide, contrary \nto their obligations under the Securities Act  and the equivalent provincia l and territorial \nsecurities legislation across Canada. He alleged that the pit wall instability and \nrockslide each resulted in a “material change” in Lundin’s “business, operations or \ncapital” and should therefore have been disclosed “forthwith” under s. 75(1) of the \nSecurities Act . He also claimed damages for negligent misrepresentation at common \nlaw. The proposed class proceeding advances claims on behalf of investors who \npurchased Lundin shares between October 25 and November 29, 2017 and seeks $175 \nmillion in general and special damages and $10 million in punitive damages.  \n[19] Mr. Markowich brought a motion under s. 138.8(1) of the Securities Act  \nfor leave to pursue the statutory cause of action. He also moved for certification of the \nproposed class proceed ing under the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 , S.O. 1992, c. 6.  \nIII. Prior Decisions  \nA. Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2022 ONSC 81 (Glustein J.)  \n[20] The motion judge dismissed the motions for leave to commence an action \nunder the Securities Act  and for class certific ation. He found that while the motion for \nleave was brought in good faith, there was no reasonable possibility that Mr. \nMarkowich could establish that either the pit wall instability or the rockslide resulted \nin a “material change” in Lundin’s affairs requ iring immediate disclosure to investors \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n pursuant to",

Neither \ndevelopment resulted in a “change” in Lundin’s “business, operations or capital”.  \n[21] The motion judge defined the “business” of an i ssuer as what it does to \ngenerate revenues; “operations” as how or where the company conducts business; and \n“capital” as the company’s share structure and rights of shareholders. He defined a \n“change” as “a different position, course, or direction” (para. 150, quoting the \ndefinition of “change” in the Merriam -Webster Dictionary  (online)). In his view, “a \nchange occurs when the event results in a different position, course, or direction to a \ncompany’s business, operations, or capital” (para. 151, citing Gree n v. Canadian \nImperial Bank of Commerce , 2012 ONSC 3637, 29 C.P.C. (7th) 225, rev’d on other \ngrounds 2014 ONCA 90, 118 O.R. (3d) 641, aff’d 2015 SCC 60, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 801, \nand Mask v.

(3d) 161).  \n[22] Although there was no direct evidence before the court on the effect of the \npit wall instability or rockslide on the Candelaria mine’s operations, there was \ncompeting expert evidence on this issue. Lundin’s expert opined that th e pit wall \ninstability was modest and localized and would have provided no reason to shut down \nother areas of the open pit or underground mines. The rockslide would have been an \nordinary event leading to only a temporary suspension of operations in a small  area of \nthe open pit mine, with minimal impact on the mine’s overall production or operations. \nBy contrast, Mr. Markowich’s expert was of the view that the pit wall instability would \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n have led to a major, crisis -level suspension of operations. The rockslid e would have \ncaused the mine to effectively cease operating, threatening its economic viability.  \n[23] The motion judge ruled that there was no basis to find that either the pit \nwall instability or the rockslide involved a “change” in Lundin’s business, operatio ns \nor capital. There was no evidence that either development led Lundin to change its line \nof business, to stop operating the mine, or to change its capital structure. Although these \ndevelopments caused Lundin to defer some of its copper mining at Candelar ia until \n2020 or 2021, the deferral represented less than 5  percent of Lundin’s annual \nproduction. Nor was there any evidence that either development threatened Lundin’s \neconomic viability. Lundin continued its business and operations as an international \nmining company. The motion judge noted that pit wall instability and rockslides are \ninherent risks in open pit mining and that Lundin managed and operated its business \nunder those risks. Finally, the motion judge found no evidence that either development \ncaused any change in Lundin’s capital structure. He stated that not every development \nthat requires additional expenditure is a material change to capital. As a result, the \nmotion judge refused leave under s. 138.8(1) and dismissed the motion for class \ncertification.  \n[24] In the alternative, the motion judge stated that had he found a change in \nLundin’s business, operations or capital, he would have granted leave. There was a \nreasonable possibility that any change would have been material, because it would \nreasona bly be expected to have had a significant effect on the market price or value of \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n Lundin’s securities.

There was competing expert evidence on the market effect of the \npit wall instability and rockslide, and the motion judge found that Mr. Markowich’s \neviden ce was credible. The conference call after Lundin’s disclosure also showed that \ninvestors were greatly concerned by these developments.  \n[25] Had the motion judge granted leave, he would have certified a class \nproceeding regarding the statutory cause of action,  which Lundin and the other \ndefendants did not oppose. However, the motion judge refused to certify the claims for \nnegligent misrepresentation at common law (this issue was not appealed further).  \nB. Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2023 ONCA 359, 166 O.R. (3d) 73 2 (Favreau J.A., \nSimmons and Benotto JJ.A. concurring)  \n[26] The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. The court held that the motion \njudge erred in law by interpreting the terms “change”, “business”, “operations”, and \n“capital” too narrowly, especially in the con text of a motion for leave to commence an \naction under the Securities Act . At this stage of the proceedings, Mr. Markowich simply \nhad to show “that he had a reasonable possibility of success based on a plausible \ninterpretation of the statute and the eviden ce” (para. 7). The court stated that the motion \njudge “adopted a restrictive interpretation of the terms at issue”, even though they \n“have not yet been definitively interpreted in the jurisprudence” (para. 7). The motion \njudge “then erred in applying that restrictive interpretation to the limited evidence \navailable at this stage in the proceedings about the consequences of the pit wall \ninstability and rockslide” (para. 7).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n [27] In the court’s view, based on a more generous interpretation of the words \n“change in the business, operations or capital”, there was a reasonable possibility that \nMr. Markowich could demonstrate that the pit wall instability and rockslide constituted \nchang es in Lundin’s operations. There was some evidence that the open pit mining \noperation was shut down for a period of time and uncontested evidence that Lundin \nmodified its schedule for the phased mining of the open pit, reduced its expected \nproduction for 2 018 and 2019, and as a result, would be required to use lower grade \nore in the near -term. Consequently, Mr. Markowich had advanced a plausible \ninterpretation and sufficient evidence to support granting leave to proceed with a \nstatutory cause of action unde r the Securities Act .  \n[28] Finally, the court noted that although Lundin and the individual defendants \nagreed that granting leave under s. 138.8(1) to commence an action should result in the \ncertification of the action, it declined to certify the class proceed ing because the motion \njudge did not address issues such as the class definition or common issues. The court \nreferred these issues back to the Superior Court for determination.  \nIV. Issues  \n[29] The main issue on this appeal is whether Mr. Markowich should have been \ngranted leave to commence an action against Lundin and the individual appellants for \ntheir alleged failure to make timely disclosure of “material changes” in Lundin’s \naffairs. This raises two questions. First, what is the test for a “material change” and \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n how does a “material change” differ from a “material fact” under the Securities Act ? \nSecond, what is the test for leave under s. 138.8(1)?  \nV. Positions of the Parties  \n[30] The appellants, Lundin and its officers and directors, submit that the Court \nof Appeal interp reted “material change” too broadly. They claim that the Court of \nAppeal erroneously focussed on the internal or external nature of a development and \nthus collapsed the distinction between a “material fact” and a “material change”. In the \nappellants’ view,  the motion judge correctly interpreted the terms “change”, \n“business”, “operations”, and “capital”, and correctly found that the pit wall instability \nand rockslide could not have resulted in a change in Lundin’s business, operations or \ncapital. The appell ants also submit that the Court",

The appell ants also submit that the Court of Appeal erred in applying the test \nfor leave under s. 138.8(1) of the Securities Act . In their view, the motion judge \ncorrectly refused to grant leave in accordance with this Court’s decision in \nTheratechnologies , because the respondent failed to advance a plausible interpretation \nof the relevant provisions of the Securities Act . \n[31] The respondent, Mr. Markowich, claims that the Court of Appeal correctly \ninterpreted the statutory term “material change”. He submits that the leg islature \nintentionally left the terms “change”, “business”, “operations”, and “capital” undefined \nto provide a flexible, remedial timely disclosure standard. In the respondent’s view, a \n“change” is not limited to fundamental shifts in the business, operati ons or capital of \nan issuer. Such a high standard would conflate change and materiality. The respondent \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n also submits that the Court of Appeal properly applied the test for leave under s. \n138.8(1) in accordance with this Court’s decision in Theratechnologie s. In his view, \nbased on the evidence available, the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that there was \na reasonable possibility of establishing a material change at trial.  \nVI. Analysis  \n[32] I will address the issues in three parts. First, I will consider the statu tory \ninterpretation of a “material change” in the business, operations or capital of a reporting \nissuer under the Securities Act . Second, I will review the test for leave under s. 138.8(1) \nand discuss whether, as the Court of Appeal found, the term “materi al change” should \nbe interpreted more flexibly at the leave stage. Finally, I will apply the relevant legal \nprinciples to this case.  \nA. The Interpretation of a Material Change  \n(1) Legislative and Policy Background  \n(a) The Role of Disclosure in Securities Regulation  \n[33] Section 1.1 of the Securities Act  identifies four purposes of the legislation: \n“(a) to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices; \n(b) to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in capital \nmarkets; (b.1) to foster capital formation; and (c) to contribute to the stability of the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n financial system and the reduction of systemic risk”. Each purpose is promoted by the \nfoundational role of disclosure in securities regulation.  \n[34] Businesses (“issuers”) is sue a wide range of investment products \n(“securities”), including shares of stock in corporations, to raise capital from investors \n(Securities Act , s. 1(1) “issuer”, “security”). The integrity of the market for securities \nnecessarily depends on the quality  of the information disclosed by issuers to investors. \nAs is well known, “[i]nvestors pay enormous amounts of money to strangers for \ncompletely intangible rights, whose value depends entirely on the quality of the \ninformation that the investors receive and  on the sellers’ honesty” (D. Johnston, K. D. \nRockwell and L. Levine, Canadian Securities Regulation  (6th ed. 2025), at ¶1.1, \nquoting B. S. Black, “The Legal and Institutional Preconditions for Strong Securities \nMarkets” (2001), 48 U.C.L.A. L. Rev.  781, at  p. 782).  \n[35] This Court has recognized that “proper disclosure is the heart and soul of \nthe securities regulations across Canada” and is pivotal for “an effective securities \nregime” ( Kerr v. Danier Leather Inc. , 2007 SCC 44, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331, at paras. 5 \nand 64). Disclosure helps maintain a “level playing field” of information between \ninvestors and issuers, which has been described as “the most fundamental principle of \nsecurities regulation” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 25, quoting Cartaway Resources \nCorp.  (Re), 2000 BCSECCOM 88,",

Ct.), at para. 40; see also Dey Remarks, at p. \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n 2362; Johnston, Rockwell a nd Levine, at ¶8.13; M.  R. Gillen, Securities Regulation in \nCanada  (4th ed. 2019), at pp. 7 -10 and 295 -98; C.  C. Nicholls, Securities Law  (3rd ed. \n2023), at pp. 362 -63; S. Rousseau, Droit des valeurs mobilières: Théorie et pratique  \n(2023), at pp. 45 -50 and 292). This Court has also recognized that the Securities Act  is \n“remedial legislation and is to be given a broad interpretation” ( Kerr , at para. 32).  \n[36] As a result, preventing and deterring informational asymmetry between \ninvestors and issuers is essential “to maintain the integrity of the securities system and \nprotect the public interest” ( British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch , [1995] \n2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 77). This is the “core policy goal that underlies securities law” ( D. \nSarro, “Material Change Standards in Securities Law” (2025), 69 Can. Bus. L.J.  1, at \np. 2, citing A. Anand and M. Condon, “Weather, Leather, and the Obligation to \nDisclose: Kerr v. Danier Leather Inc .” (2006), 44 Osgoode Hall L.J.  727, at pp. 735 -\n36, an d H. A.

Iacobucci, “On Lemons and Leather: Liability for Misrepresentations of \nForward -looking Information in Danier Leather ” (2009), 48 Can. Bus. L.J.  3, at pp. \n15-17). \n[37] Disclosure also promotes the efficiency of capital markets by helping \ninvestors to identify and direct capital to the most deserving public companies. Armed \nwith appropriate information, investors are more confident and participate more \nactively in secur ities markets, thereby enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of \ncapital markets more generally ( Theratechnologies , at para. 26; Johnston, Rockwell \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n and Levine, at ¶8.14; Gillen, at p. 295; Rousseau (2023), at pp. 42 -44; J. Biron, \n“Gouvernance et asse mblées d’actionnaires”, in Jurisclasseur Québec — Collection \nDroit des affaires — Valeurs mobilières  (loose -leaf), fasc. 8, at No. 41).  \n(b) Disclosure of Material Facts in the Primary Market  \n[38] To illustrate the meaning of a material fact, it is useful to conside r the \ndisclosure required when an issuer first sells its securities directly to investors, known \nas an “initial public offering” or “IPO”. An issuer undertaking such an offering is said \nto be participating in the “primary market” for its securities (Johnst on, Rockwell and \nLevine , at ¶12.69; Gillen, at pp. 238 -40; Nicholls, at pp. 6 -7; Rousseau (2023), at pp. \n131-33 and 148 -51).

An issuer commonly becomes a “reporting issuer” by preparing a \ncomprehensive disclosure document, known as a prospectus, filing it with securities \nregulators under the securities law of a jurisdiction, and delivering it to purchasers of \nthe securities (Johnston , Rockwell and Levine , at ¶7.5; Gillen, at pp. 197 -202; Nicholls, \nat pp. 7 -8; Rousseau (2023), at pp. 148 -51; Securities Act , s. 1(1) “reporting issuer”). \nA prospectus must provide “full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts  relating \nto the securities issued or proposed to be distributed” (s. 56(1)).  \n[39] A “material fact” is defined under the Ontario Securities Act  as “a f act that \nwould reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value \nof the securities” (s. 1(1)).

As elaborated below , a reporting issuer whose \nshares trade on the secondary market is subject to continuous disclosure obligations, \nwhich require regular, ongoing disclosure of certain information to investors and to the \nrelevant provincial or territorial securities regulato r.  \n[41] There are two categories of continuous disclosure obligations.

Material \nchanges must generally be disclosed “forthwith” by issuing and filing “a news release \nauthorized by a senior officer discl osing the nature and substance of the change” (s. \n75(1); see also Theratechnologies , at para. 24; Johnston , Rockwell and Levine , at ¶¶8.3, \n8.106 and 8.107; Gillen, at p. 293; Nicholls, at p. 388; Rousseau (2023), at pp. 320 -22).  \n[43] As previously stated, a “material change” (in relation to an issuer other than \nan investment fund) is defined in relevant part as “a change in the business, operations \nor capital of the issuer that would reasonably be expected to have a significant effect \non the market price or v alue of any of the securities of the issuer” (s. 1(1)). Decisions \nto implement such a change, made by the board of directors or by senior management \nwhere they believe that confirmation by the board of directors is probable, are also \ndefined as material ch anges (s. 1(1)). Similar definitions are contained in the provincial \nand territorial securities legislation across Canada ( Securities Act (B.C.), s. 1(1); \nSecurities Act (Alta.), s. 1(ff); The Securities Act, 1988 (Sask.), s. 2(1)(y); The \nSecurities Act (Man.), s. 1(1); Securities Act (Que.), s. 5.3; Securities Act (N.B.), s. \n1(1); Securities Act (N.S.), s. 2(1)(v); Securities Act (P.E.I.), s. 1(1)(ff); Securities Act \n(N.L.), s. 2(1)(w); Securities Act (N.W.T.), s. 1(1); Securities Act (Yukon), s. 1(1); \nSecurities Act (Nu.), s. 1(1)).  \n[44] As this Court has noted, the statutory definition of a “material change” has \ntwo components. First, there must be “a change in the business, operations or capital \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n of the issuer”. A change in any one of the issuer’s business, op erations or capital is \nsufficient. Second, the change must be material, which means that it “would reasonably \nbe expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the securities” \nof the issuer. Both components are required to trigger an  obligation of timely disclosure \n(Theratechnologies , at para. 40; Securities Act , s. 1(1); see also Cornish , at para. 46).  \n[45] Since 2004, most continuous disclosure obligations for Canadian reporting \nissuers have been consolidated in a national instrument ado pted by securities regulators \nnationwide, which sets out harmonized disclosure obligations found in provincial and \nterritorial legislation (Ontario Securities Commission, National Instrument 51 -102, \nContinuous Disclosure Obligations  (2004), 27 OSCB 3439 (“ NI 51 -102”); see also \nJohnston , Rockwell and Levine , at ¶8.2; Gillen, at p. 300; Nicholls, at p. 364; Rousseau \n(2023), at p. 291). Regulators have also issued a policy statement on disclosure \nstandards that identifies examples of potentially “material info rmation”, which \nencompasses both material facts and material changes (Ontario Securities Commission, \nNational Policy 51 -201, Disclosure Standards , (2002), 25 OSCB 4492, s. 4.3). \nHowever, this policy cannot, and does not, replace the statutory tests for ide ntifying \n“material facts” and “material changes” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 53; Sarro, at p. 8, \nfn. 47).  \n(2) The Distinction Between a “Material Fact” and a “Material Change”  \n[46] The distinction between a “material fact” and a “material change”, both of \nwhich ar e defined by legislation, must be resolved under the modern principle of \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n statutory interpretation.

A statutory provision is interpreted based on its text, context, \nand purpose to find a meaning that is harmonious with the legislation as a whole ( Rizzo \n& Ri zzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; Canada Trustco Mortgage \nCo. v. Canada , 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10; Canada (Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov , 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. \n117).  \n[47] The di stinction between a material fact and a material change has been \ndescribed as a “conundrum” (Anand and Condon, at p. 730), and sometimes causes \n“considerable uncertainty” (Johnston , Rockwell and Levine , at ¶6.9) and “considerable \nconfusion” (Ontario, Five Year Review Committee Final Report — Reviewing the \nSecurities Act (Ontario)  (2003, Purdy Crawford, chair) (“Crawford Report”), at p. 142). \nDetermining whether a material change has occurred is a contextual question of mixed \nfact and law (see Cornish , at pa ras. 51 and 53). Even so, several guiding principles \nfrom the case law and expert commentary help explain the distinction.  \n(a) A Material Fact Is Static; A Material Change Is Dynamic  \n[48] A material fact is “static”, because it provides a snapshot of an issuer’s \naffairs at a particular point in time. A material change is “dynamic”, because it \nnecessarily compares an issuer’s affairs at two points in time (Johnston , Rockwell and \nLevine , at ¶6.8; see also Kerr , at para. 38, citing Dey Remarks, at p. 2368). For a \nmater ial change to occur, “there must be a ‘change’ (as opposed to the existence of a \n‘fact’)” (Crawford Report, at p. 143; see also J.  D. Fraiberg and R.  Yalden, “Kerr v. \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n Danier Leather Inc. : Disclosure, Deference and the Duty to Update Forward -Looking \nInforma tion” (2006), 43 Can. Bus. L.J.  106, at p. 109).  \n[49] The distinction between a material fact and a material change “is perhaps \nbest understood from the perspective of the evolution of an issuer’s disclosure record” \n(Crawford Report, at p. 142). To illustrate, recall the role of a prospectus as a base \ndisclosure document that must contain full, true, and plain disclosure of all material \nfacts relating to the securities issued or proposed to be issued. Any fact will be a \nmaterial fact, whether or not it is relate d to the issuer, if it would reasonably be expected \nto have a significant effect on the market price or value of the securities being issued. \nAfter a preliminary prospectus has been filed, the issuer must update its disclosure \nwhenever there is a material change in its business, operations or capital (p. 142; see \nalso Dey Remarks, at p. 2368).  \n(b) A Material Fact Is Defined More Broadly Than a Material Change  \n[50] A material fact is defined more broadly than a material change. “[O]nly \nchanges in an issuer’s ‘busine ss, operations or capital’ can be material changes, but any \nfact can be a material fact” (Johnston , Rockwell and Levine , at ¶6.8; see also Kerr , at \nparas. 35 and 38; Pezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers) , [1994] 2 \nS.C.R. 557, at p. 597).

Pu t another way, “the ‘change’ must be in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer”, while “a material ‘fact’ can be unrelated to an \nissuer’s business, operations or capital as long as it has a significant effect on the market \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n price or value of the securities being issued” (Crawford Report, at p. 143; see also \nFraiberg and Yalden, at p. 109).  \n(c) A Material Change Is Internal to the Issuer; A Material Fact Can Be \nInternal or External to the Issuer  \n[51] A material change must be internal  to the issuer — there must be a change \n“in the business, operations or capital of the issuer” (s. 1(1)). External political, \neconomic, and social developments cannot give rise to a material change, unless the \ndevelopment results in a change in the business, operations or capital of the issuer, and  \nunless the change is material.  \n[52] In Kerr , this Court applied the distinction between internal and external \ndevelopments and held that Danier Leather Inc., a leather apparel company, was not \nrequired to update its prospectus to make timely disclosure of poor  intra-quarterly \nfinancial results caused by unseasonably warm weather — an external factor — \nbecause it did not involve a change in the company’s business, operations or capital. \nThe company was entitled to wait until its next round of periodic disclosure  before \ndisclosing what was accepted to be a material fact. Poor intra -quarterly results, the \nCourt explained, may reflect a material change in business operations, even though the \nresults themselves would not amount to a material change:  \nIt almost goes wi thout saying that poor intra -quarterly results may \nreflect  a material change in business operations. A company that has, for \nexample, restructured its operations may experience poor intra -quarterly \nresults because of this restructuring, but it is the restr ucturing and not the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n results themselves that would amount to a material change and thus trigger \nthe disclosure obligation. Additionally, poor intra -quarterly results may \nmotivate a company to implement a change in its business, operations or \ncapital in an effort to improve performance. Again, though, the disclosure \nobligation would be triggered by the change in the business, operations or \ncapital, and not by the results themselves. [Emphasis in original; para. 47.]  \n[53] By comparison, in Pezim , this Court held t hat information contained in \ndrilling results for a company’s mine, an internal development, could amount to a \nmaterial change in the “business, operations, assets or ownership of the issuer” (pp. \n574-75, quoting Securities Act  (B.C.), s. 1(1)), and thus w ould have to be disclosed on \na timely basis. As the Court explained, “from the point of view of investors, new \ninformation relating to a mining property (which is an asset) bears significantly on the \nquestion of that property’s value”, and thus “a change i n assay and drilling results can \namount to a material change, depending on the circumstances” (p. 600). In addition, \nthe Court ruled that the issuer’s failure to make timely disclosure of a multimillion -\ndollar contractual dispute, another internal developm ent, also involved a failure to \ndisclose a material change (p. 606).  \n[54] An example of an external development that caused a material change in \nan issuer’s affairs arose in Coventree  Inc. (2011), 34 OSCB 10209 , aff’d Cornish  v. \nOntario Securities Commission , 2013 ONSC 1310, 306 O.A.C. 107 (Div. Ct.) . The \nOntario Securities Commissi on ruled that Coventree Inc., an investment bank \nspecializing in structured finance, failed to comply with its obligation to file a material \nchange report after a credit rating agency  issued a press release advising that it would \nno longer provide credit ratings for certain credit arbitrage transactions.

The Commission ruled \nthat the company had an obligation to discl ose the credit rating agency’s press release \nand subsequent liquidity events it experienced as material changes because investors \nlikely would not have been able to fully assess the effect on Coventree’s affairs as these \nevents were unfolding.  \n[55] Although a material change is necessarily internal to the issuer, a material \nfact may be internal or external. In Kerr , for example, the unseasonably warm weather \nthat led to the decline in Danier Leather’s intra -quarterly financial performance was a \nmaterial fact ex ternal to the issuer (para. 48). By contrast, examples of material facts \ninternal to an issuer could include an issuer’s board of directors engaging financial \nadvisers for the recapitalization of a company (Crawford Report, p. 143, fn. 290) or \nnegotiating a material acquisition (Dey Remarks, at p. 2366; Fraiberg and Yalden, at \npp. 109 -10). \n[56] The distinction between a material fact and a material change, and \nparticularly the requirement that a material change be internal to the issuer, is \n“deliberate and polic y-based” ( Kerr , at para. 38). There are two main policy reasons \nfor the distinction.  \n[57] First, the distinction balances the burdens that disclosure places on issuers \nwith the need for investors to be informed on a timely basis of material developments \nin an i ssuer’s affairs. The distinction “relieve[s] reporting issuers of the obligation to \ncontinually interpret external political, economic and social developments as they \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n affect the affairs of the issuer, unless the external change will result in a change in t he \nbusiness, operations or capital of the issuer, in which case, timely disclosure of the \nchange must be made” ( Kerr , at para. 38 (emphasis deleted), quoting Dey Remarks, at \np. 2368; see also Crawford Report, at p. 143; Fraiberg and Yalden, at p. 110;  R. \nProvencher et al., “Information continue”, in Jurisclasseur Québec — Collection Droit \ndes affaires — Valeurs mobilières  (loose -leaf), fasc. 4, at No. 67).  \n[58] Second, the distinction between a material fact and a material change \npromotes the purpose of securiti es law to remedy informational asymmetry between \nissuers and investors. As Professor Sarro explains, there is generally no informational \nasymmetry between issuers and investors regarding external political, social, and \neconomic developments (p. 22). Extern al developments are usually in the public \ndomain, and apart from situations such as in Coventree where investors have very \nlimited knowledge about an opaque market (para. 641), the impact of external \ndevelopments on an issuer’s financial performance is “ty pically ascertainable by \nreviewing [an issuer’s] existing disclosure record” (Sarro, at p. 3; see also Fraiberg and \nYalden, at p. 110). On the other hand, there is often an informational asymmetry \nregarding internal developments in an issuer’s business, op erations, and capital. \nInternal developments are usually not in the public domain, and thus investors “cannot \nreasonably be expected to discover [them] on their own” (Sarro, at p. 3). Requiring \ntimely disclosure of a material change thus helps level the in formational playing field \nbetween issuers and investors.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n (d) A Material Change Generally Requires More Than Mere Negotiations or \nInternal Deliberations  \n[59] Negotiations and internal deliberations, without more, will not usually \namount to a change in the business, operations or capital of the issuer, even if they are \nmaterial.  \n[60] For example, in AiT Advanced Information Technologies Corporation \n(2008), 31 OSCB 712, the Ontario Securities Commission ruled that a proposed merger \ntransaction was not a material change unle ss there was a “substantial likelihood that the \ntransaction would be completed” (para. 6",

The Commission stated \nthat “where the proposed transaction is speculative, contingent and surrounded by \nuncertainties, a commitment from one part y to proceed will not be sufficient to \nconstitute a material change” (para. 223). Instead, there must be “sufficient \ncommitment from both parties of the transaction to determine whether a ‘decision to \nimplement’ the transaction has taken place” (para. 223) . As Professor Sarro explains, \nthis is justifiable from a policy perspective “because managers do not yet have reliable \ninformation about the likely outcomes of these processes that could be shared with \ninvestors” (p. 3). This again promotes the goal of ef fectively remedying informational \nasymmetry: any information held by management regarding negotiations or internal \ndeliberations becomes much more useful to investors once “the information available \nto management provides a meaningful signal about outcomes ” (p. 23).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n [61] As a further example, in Theratechnologies , this Court ruled that routine \ncorrespondence with a regulator did not amount to a change in the issuer’s affairs. The \nCourt held  that a drug company did not breach its obligation of timely disclosure b y \nnot immediately disclosing questions from the United States Food and Drug \nAdministration (“FDA”) during the drug approval process about a drug’s potential side \neffects. The company had previously publicly disclosed the potential side effects and \nexplaine d why they were not clinically significant. The FDA’s questions, the Court \nstated, did “not constitute a departure from the normal FDA process” and were a \n“routine step”, and thus could not involve any change in the company’s business, \noperations or capita l (para. 51).  \n[62] Similarly, in Peters v. SNC -Lavalin Group Inc. , 2023 ONCA 360, 166 O.R. \n(3d) 756, released with the decision under appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled \nthat a company did not have to make timely disclosure of a telephone call from fe deral \nprosecutors advising the company that it would not be invited to negotiate a \nremediation agreement to resolve a pending criminal prosecution. The company faced \nthe prospect of prosecution before the call, and continued to face that prospect after the  \ncall. The company had publicly disclosed the risk of prosecution on many occasions \nand, even after the call, prosecutors agreed to receive further submissions on the \ncompany’s request for a remediation agreement. As a result, the court held, the \ntelephone  call could not have resulted in a material change.  \n(3) The Motion Judge Erred in Interpreting “Material Change”  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n [63] In light of the above principles from the jurisprudence and scholarly \ncommentary, in my respectful view, the motion judge erred in interpreting “material \nchange” in three related respects. First, the motion judge interpreted the meaning of a \n“change” restrictively by relying on a dictionary definition, rather than interpreting the \nword in context and with recognition that the legislature intention ally left the term \nundefined for it to acquire meaning by being applied in specific factual circumstances. \nSecond, the motion judge effectively incorporated statements from lower court cases \nrequiring a change to be “important and substantial” into the def inition of “change” \nitself, without grounding the interpretation in the purpose of securities legislation to \naddress informational asymmetries between issuers and investors. Third, the motion \njudge interpreted “business, operations or capital” by proposing  restrictive definitions \nof each of these undefined terms drawn from case law, even though the legislature \nintentionally left these terms undefined to preserve their ordinary commercial meaning \nand flexibility as required by specific factual circumstances.  \n(a) A “Change” Should Not Be Interpreted Restrictively  \n[64] I agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the motion judge erred \nby relying on a dictionary definition of “change” as “a different position, course, or \ndirection”. The Court of Appeal stated that  the motion judge provided “no support for \nusing this definition from",

The Court of Appeal stated that  the motion judge provided “no support for \nusing this definition from any case law interpreting the definition of ‘material change’ \nin the Securities Act , nor does he provide any rationale for adopting this definition of \n‘change’ in the context of the Secu rities Act ” (para. 59). The court added that “what \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n qualifies as a ‘change’ must be looked at in reference to the terms ‘business, operations \nor capital’, and in the context of the facts of each case” (para. 82). In my view, the \ninherent flexibility of what  can be a “change” suggests that the ordinary meaning of \nthis term should not be constrained by dictionary definitions. In that sense, the Court \nof Appeal was correct to say that “a change is a change” (para. 82). In this context, such \nsimplicity promotes,  rather than abdicates, the task of statutory interpretation. By \ncontrast, as I will explain, several difficulties arise in relying solely on a dictionary \ndefinition of the undefined term “change” under the  Securities Act .  \n[65] At the outset, I stress that it is not unusual or necessarily wrong to start the \nprocess of statutory interpretation with a dictionary definition. To understand the \nmeaning of undefined words, judges and lawyers often look to dictionaries “as a \nstarting point in the interpretive process”  (Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. , [1995] 2 \nS.C.R. 1031, at para. 67).  \n[66] At the same time, dictionary definitions cannot determine the meaning of \nlegislation (see, e.g., Telus Communications Inc. v. Federation of Canadian \nMunicipalities , 2025 SCC 15, at pa ra. 43). There are several reasons why courts should \nbe cautious when relying on them.  \n[67] First, the meaning of words “may differ significantly from one dictionary \nto the next”, and “even minor differences in the way words are defined can make a \ndifference in  the outcome of a case” (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes  (7th ed. \n2022), at § 3:03[3]).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n [68] Second, and more fundamentally, dictionary definitions focus on the \ntypical usage of words, rather than on the full range of intended application of a word \nthat the legislature expressly left undefined. To quote Professor Ruth Sullivan, \n“dictionary definitions .  . . communicate the senses of a word rather than its range of \npossible reference — its connotation or intension rather than its denotation or \nextension ” (§ 3:03[3]). As she explains:  \nConnotative or inten[s]ional meaning focuses on the common or typical \nattributes found in the usage of a given sense of a word .  . . . Denotative or \nextensive meaning refers to the things to which a word may correctly be \napplied. Since the denotation of words is unpredictable and indeterminate, \nit cannot be fully captured in a definition. [§ 3:03[3]]  \n[69] Third, dictionary definitions “can say very little about the meaning of a \nword as used in a particular context” (Sullivan, at §  3:02[4]; see also P.-A. Côté and \nM. Devinat, Interprétation des lois  (5th ed. 2021), at para. 982, citing R. v. Monney , \n[1999] 1 S.C.R. 652, at para. 26). Under the modern principle, interpreting  “a phrase in \na statute does not simply involve transposing a dictionary definition of each word. The \nphrase has to be construed according to its context and the underlying purpose of the \nprovision” (A. Burrows, Thinking About Statutes: Interpretation, Interaction, \nImprovement  (2018), at pp.  6-7, quoting An Informer v. A Chief Constable , [2012] \nEWCA Civ 197, [2013] Q.B. 579, at para. 67).  \n[70",

As the Court of Appeal noted, “a change is a change” (para. 82).  \n[72] Second, the legislature used the term “change” in the particular context of \nsecurities legislation, where the purpose of continuous disclosure obligations is to level \nthe info rmational playing field between issuers and investors. The word “change” takes \nmeaning from this context, the facts of each case, and the relevant industry norms, \nrather than from a strict legal formula.  \n[73] Third, by leaving the term “change” undefined, the l egislature has \nmaintained flexibility for the Securities Act  to apply to widely varying factual \nscenarios. A rigid or technical definition of “change” could limit the effectiveness of \nthe legislation across a broad range of industries or corporate structur es. \n[74] Finally, although the legislature left “change” undefined, regulators and \ncourts have provided helpful interpretive guidance on what constitutes a “material \nchange” in various policy documents and judicial decisions, which collectively help \nillustrate the meaning of the expression.  \n[75] In sum, substituting a dictionary definition for the intentionally undefined \nterm “change” restricts the reach of the legislation, contrary to the legislature’s purpose.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n (b) A Development Need Not Be “Important and Substantial” T o Constitute a \n“Change”  \n[76] The motion judge’s second error was to couple the dictionary definition of \n“change” with statements from lower court decisions suggesting that a change in the \nissuer’s business, operations or capital must be “substantial” or “impor tant” to \nconstitute a change (paras. 150 -51, citing Green (Sup.  Ct.) and Mask ). The motion \njudge’s assessment of these lower court decisions effectively meant that only \ndevelopments that constitute a substantial or important “different position, course, or  \ndirection” in the affairs of the issuer would need to be evaluated for materiality \n(paras.  150-51). As the Court of Appeal correctly noted (at paras. 80 -81), however, the \nmotion judge’s approach effectively imported a consideration of the magnitude or \nsignificance of a development in an issuer’s affairs as a threshold for whether it \nconstitutes a change, collapsing the two steps for a material change — “change in the \nbusiness, operations or capital”, and “materiality” — into one step.  \n[77] I agree with the Cour t of Appeal that the first step is qualitative, in that it \ninvolves evaluating the nature of the change. The second step considers its magnitude \n(paras. 80 -81). As the court noted, “[m]ateriality is objectively determined from the \nperspective of a reasonab le investor, and the applicable standard is defined in strictly \neconomic terms” (para. 81, citing Kerr v. Danier Leather Inc.  (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 321 \n(C.A.), at para. 53, aff’d 2007 SCC 44, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331, Cornish , at paras. 55 and \n65-66, Rex Diamond  Mining v.

For this reason, it would be inappropriate to import qualifiers such as \n“core”, “fundamental”, or “key” into the undefined term “change”. Whether a change \nis significant is a question of materiality.   \n[78] Contrary to the appellants’ submission, this approach will not require \nissuers to evaluate whether every minor internal event within a company needs to be \ndisclosed as a “material change” — the “materiality” requirement avoids this. Often, \nthe materiality of a “change” will be obvious. Issuers are well -positioned to assess \nwhether a “change” is material, given their industry knowledge and intimate familiarity \nwith their business, operations, and capital.   \n[79] I also agree with Professor Sarro tha t two rival standards have developed \nin the jurisprudence. The first standard sticks closely to the relevant statutory language \nand holds that any development representing a “change in the business, operations or \ncapital of the issuer” is a change and henc e, if material, must be disclosed immediately \n(Theratechnologies , at para. 40, quoting Securities Act  (Que.), s. 5.3). This broad \ndisclosure standard is described as “investor -friendly, in that it encourages companies \nto err on the side of disclosing new d evelopments sooner rather than later” (Sarro, at p. \n2). The second “manager -friendly standard” is narrower and “gives the managers of \npublic companies more scope to delay disclosure of new developments” (pp. 2 -3). It \nprovides that “a change does not need t o be disclosed immediately unless it is not only \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n material but also ‘important and substantial,’ involving ‘significant disruption or \ninterference’ to the company’s business — so significant, perhaps, that it threatens to \nrender the issuer ‘no longer able t o carry on its principal business’” (p. 2, quoting Green \n(Sup.  Ct.), at para. 28, and Mask (Sup.  Ct.), at paras. 57 -58). \n[80] In my view, the narrower disclosure standard is inconsistent with the text \nof the legislation, which, apart from the question of materi ality, simply refers to a \n“change”, not an important, substantial, significant, core, key, or high -level change. \nUnlike subclause (a)(ii) of the material change definition, which deals with decisions \nto implement changes rather than the changes themselves,  there is no reference to high -\nlevel corporate decision -making in subcl.  (a)(i), and nothing in its language to indicate \nthat a change must result from decisions taken by senior management. The narrower \ndisclosure standard would also be legally indetermina te. It would provide no guidance \nfor how important, substantial, significant, core, key, or high -level the change would \nhave to be in order to qualify as a “change”. The meaning of all these terms would be \nin the eye of the beholder.  \n[81] As Professor Sarro cor rectly explains, the narrower disclosure standard, \nrequiring that a development be “important and substantial” to result in a change, is \nalso mistaken as a matter of doctrine and policy (see pp. 1 -5 and 12 -25). It is mistaken \nas a matter of doctrine, becau se this Court’s decisions in Kerr  and Theratechnologies  \ndid not interpret a “material change” as requiring a change to be “important and \nsubstantial” or a “significant disruption and interference” regarding a company’s \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n affairs, nor did they require the iss uer to “no longer [be] able to carry on its principal \nbusiness” (Sarro, at p.  18, quoting Green  (Sup. Ct.), at para. 28, and Mask  (Sup. Ct.), \nat para. 57). Such developments may be sufficient to constitute a change, but",

Ct.), at para. 28, and Mask  (Sup. Ct.), \nat para. 57). Such developments may be sufficient to constitute a change, but they are \nnot necessary.  \n[82] Further, th e language of “important and substantial”, which was adopted \nfrom the Superior Court’s decision in Green , was clearly obiter  in that case. It involved \na passing reference in a 623 -paragraph decision paraphrasing the elements of a material \nchange where the main issue before the court was whether misrepresentation claims \nunder the Securities Act  were statute -barred. Neither the Court of Appeal for Ontario \nnor this Court in Green  adopted the Superior Court’s language.  \n[83] The language from the Superior Court’s dec ision in Green was, however, \nthen followed and elaborated upon by that court in Mask , as requiring “a significant \ndisruption or interference in the ongoing operation of the business itself” or a threat to \nits ability “to carry on its principal business” (p ara. 57, quoting Coventree , at para. 583; \nsee also paras. 56 and 58). It was then applied again by the Superior Court in Coffin v. \nAtlantic Power Corp. , 2015 ONSC 3686, 127 O.R. (3d) 199, at para. 107, where the \ncourt asked whether the issuer remained “able to carry on its principal business” despite \nthe alleged material change.   \n[84] The narrower disclosure standard is also mistaken as a matter of policy. I n \nthe brief discussion of the material change standard in Green , the Superior Court stated \nthat one rationale for limiting timely disclosure is that “[t]he sporadic disclosure of bits \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n and pieces of information that investors might find interesting could in  fact be \nmisleading or even harmful without the balance that is afforded by [other periodic \ndisclosures]” (para. 28). As Professor Sarro explains, however, a broader disclosure \nstandard would not “necessarily .  . . mean flooding investors with low -quality,  \nmisleading information” (p. 20). There is also no reason to think that the broader \nstandard — which already reflects the legal status quo arising from several judgments \nof this Court such as Pezim , Kerr , and Theratechnologies  — would give rise to \nunmanage able liability concerns for issuers, directors and officers, much less to \nconcerns justifying adoption of the narrower standard.  \n[85] By contrast, the broader disclosure standard is sound as a matter of policy \nbecause it promotes the fundamental purposes of th e Securities Act . It is firmly rooted \nin a “core concern of securities law: the asymmetry of information that exists between \nissuers’ managers and current and prospective investors in these issuers” (Sarro, at \np. 21, citing Anand and Condon, at pp. 735 -36, and Sale, at pp. 1045 -46). To quote \nProfessor Sarro again:  \nWithout disclosure requirements that mitigate this asymmetry, market \nparticipants are less well -placed to make informed decisions about whether \nto buy or sell an issuer’s securities, rendering market prices less reflective \nof an issuer’s future prospects. [Footnote omitted; pp. 21 -22.]  \n[86] Relatedly, the Ontario Securities Commission has repeatedly advised that \ntechnical interpretations of the language of the legislation would not advance the \npurpose of promoting disclosure and protecting the investing public,  and that in \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n borderline cases, an issuer should err on the side of disclosure ( Coventree , at para. 146, \nand Cornish , at para. 48, both citing YBM Magnex International Inc.  (2003), 26 OSCB \n5285, at para. 518).  \n[87] In my view, therefore, the motion judge erred b y applying the narrower \ndisclosure standard for a material change, effectively requiring that a change be \n“important and substantial” before it is assessed for materiality.  \n(c) The Phrase “Business, Operations or Capital” Should Not Be Interpreted \nRestrictivel y \n[88] Finally, the motion judge drew on case law to adopt restrictive definitions \nof the undefined terms appearing in the phrase",

The \nmotion judge defined “business” as “what the company does” (paras. 153 -54, drawing \non Covent ree, at para. 76, and Rex Diamond Mining Corporation  (2008), 31 OSCB \n8337, at paras. 10 -11 and 222); “operations” as “the activities conducted by the \ncompany to engage in its lines of ‘business’” (para. 156; see also para. 155, drawing on \nRex Diamond (Ont.  Sec. Comm.), at paras. 8 and 11); and “capital” as a corporation’s \n“share structure and rights of shareholders” (para. 158).  \n[89] There is nothing wrong in principle in drawing on case law to illustrate the \nmeaning of the terms appearing in the phrase “busines s, operations or capital”. With \nrespect, however, the motion judge went beyond illustration by coupling his earlier \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n restrictive interpretation of “change” as “a different position, course, or direction”, with \nrestrictive definitions of the terms “business” , “operations” and “capital”.  \n[90] Not only are the terms “business”, “operations”, and “capital” not defined \nin the Securities Act , they are also not defined in the leading judicial decisions (see, \ne.g., Pezim ; Kerr (SCC); Theratechnologies ; Green ); in the lea ding regulatory \ndecisions (see, e.g., YBM Magnex ; AiT; Rex Diamond (Ont. Sec. Comm.); Coventree ); \nin the leading securities law textbooks (see, e.g., Johnston , Rockwell and Levine ; \nGillen; Nicholls; Rousseau (2023)); or in the key regulatory instruments or  policy \nstatements (see, e.g., NI 51 -102; National Policy 51 -201).  \n[91] There are several reasons why the legislature left the terms “business”, \n“operations”, and “capital” undefined.  \n[92] First, “business”, “operations”, and “capital” are widely understood \ncommerc ial concepts. The Securities Act  relies on the ordinary commercial meaning of \nthese terms, rather than creating rigid statutory definitions.  \n[93] Second, securities legislation must be applied to a wide range of industries \nand financial structures. Leaving the  terms undefined allows courts and regulators to \napply the legislation broadly and flexibly as the context and circumstances require.  \n[94] Finally, in the context of continuous disclosure obligations, “change in the \nbusiness, operations or capital” is a holist ic standard for assessing corporate \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n \n developments that may require disclosure. That standard must be applied based on the \npurpose of disclosure requirements to level the informational asymmetry between \nissuers and investors, rather than by parsing each elem ent separately.  \n[95] To conclude, importing regulatory or judicial definitions for the \nintentionally undefined terms “business, operations or capital” would ossify the \nSecurities Act  and would undermine the purpose of continuous disclosure obligations \nunder se curities legislation.  \n(4) Summary  \n[96] Material changes are dynamic, related to changes in the issuer’s business, \noperations or capital, internal rather than external to the issuer, and usually involve \nmore than mere negotiations or internal deliberations. They are  distinct from the \nbroader category of material facts. Like material facts, however, material changes must \nbe reasonably expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of \nsecurities.  \n[97] Whether there has been a material change in a given c ase is a highly \ncontextual question of mixed fact and law (see Cornish , at paras. 51 and 53; AiT, at \nparas. 214 -15). There is no bright line test and this determination is not a science, but \nrather a matter of judgment and common sense applied to the uniqu e circumstances of \neach case ( YBM Magnex , at paras. 90 and 518; Coventree , at paras. 159 -60; Cornish , \nat paras.",

At the same time, disclosure decisions \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n \n are a matter of legal obligation, and thus are “not to be subordi nated to the exercise of \nbusiness judgment.  . . . It is for the legislature and the courts, not business management, \nto set the legal disclosure requirements” ( Kerr (SCC), at para. 55; see also Coventree , \nat paras. 162 -63; Cornish , at para. 55; AiT, at para. 228; Rex Diamond  (Ont. Sec. \nComm.), at para. 238).  \n[98] The contextual exercise of identifying a material change is guided by the \npurpose of disclosure obligations to level informational asymmetry between issuers and \ninvestors, which serves to mainta in the integrity of the securities system and protect the \npublic interest (see Theratechnologies , at para. 25; Branch , at para. 77).  \nB. The Test for Leave To Commence an Action Under the Securities Act  \n[99] The second issue on this appeal concerns the test for le ave under s. 138.8(1) \nof the Securities Act , which requires the court to be satisfied that “the action is being \nbrought in good faith” and that “there is a reasonable possibility that the action will be \nresolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff”.  \n(1) Legisl ative and Policy Background  \n[100]  This Court reviewed the background to the creation of a statutory cause of \naction for secondary market misrepresentation in both Theratechnologies  and Green . \nHistorically, investors in Canada had no statutory cause of action whe n they incurred \nlosses as a result of breach of continuous disclosure obligations under securities \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n legislation. The remedies available under the common law tort of negligent \nmisrepresentation and under the Civil Code of Québec  were difficult to obtain beca use \nthey required investors to prove that they had relied on a misrepresentation or omission \nto their detriment. This could be extremely hard to prove in the context of secondary \nmarket transactions ( Theratechnologies , at paras. 27 -28; Green  (SCC), at para s. 64 -\n65). \n[101]  After several high -profile disclosure scandals in the 1990s, the Toronto \nStock Exchange created the Allen Committee to re -evaluate the secondary market \ndisclosure regime. The Allen Committee concluded that the regulatory sanctions \navailable at t he time were “inadequate” and that common law remedies were “so \ndifficult to pursue that they are, as a practical matter, largely hypothetical” \n(Theratechnologies , at para. 29, quoting Toronto Stock Exchange Committee on \nCorporate Disclosure, Final Report — Responsible Corporate Disclosure: A Search \nfor Balance  (1997, Thomas I. A. Allen, Q.C., chairman) (“Allen Report”), at p.  5; see \nalso Green  (SCC), at para. 64). To address these shortcomings, the Allen Committee \nrecommended creating a statutory cause of action for breach of continuous disclosure \nobligations that would relieve investors of the requirement to prove detrimental reliance \non the misrepresentation or omission ( Theratechnologies , at para. 29; Green (SCC), at \npara. 65). The goal was “improved det errence”, with the expectation that “effective \ndeterrence will logically reduce the need for investor compensation” ( Green  (SCC), at \npara. 65, quoting Allen Report, at p. vii).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n [102]  In 2000, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella organization \nfor Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators, adopted the Allen \nCommittee’s recommendation to create a statutory cause of action ( Theratechnologies , \nat para. 30). At the same time, the Canadian Securities Administrators also \nrecommended includ ing a threshold “screening mechanism” requiring a plaintiff to \nobtain leave of a court to commence an action",

At the same time, the Canadian Securities Administrators also \nrecommended includ ing a threshold “screening mechanism” requiring a plaintiff to \nobtain leave of a court to commence an action. This was seen as needed to deter U.S. -\nstyle entrepreneurial “strike suits”, or meritless litigation brought to coerce unjust \nsettlements. The goal  was to “try to ensure that unmeritorious litigation, and the time \nand expense it imposes on defendants, is avoided or brought to an end early in the \nlitigation process” (para. 30 (emphasis deleted), quoting “Proposal for a Statutory Civil \nRemedy for Inves tors in the Secondary Market and Response to the Proposed Change \nto the Definitions of ‘Material Fact’ and ‘Material Change’”, CSA Notice 53 -302, \nreproduced in (2000), 23 OSCB 7383, at p. 7390; see also Green (SCC), at paras. 65 \nand 68; Amaya inc. v.

The plaintiff must show that (1) the action was instituted in \ngood faith; and (2) there is a “reasonable possibility” that the action will be resolved at \ntrial in favour of  the plaintiff. Other provinces and territories have adopted similar \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n \n provisions (see Securities Act (B.C.), s. 140.8(1) and (2); Securities Act (Alta.), s. \n211.08(1) and (2); The Securities Act, 1988  (Sask.), s. 136.4(1) and (2); The Securities \nAct (Man.),  s. 191(1) and (2); Securities Act  (Que.), s. 225.4; Securities Act (N.B.), s. \n161.41(1); Securities Act (N.S.), s. 146H(1); Securities Act (P.E.I.), s. 129(1) and (2); \nSecurities Act (N.L.), s. 138.8(1) and (2); Securities Act (N.W.T.), s. 129(1) and (2); \nSecurities Act (Yukon), s. 129(1) and (2); Securities Act (Nu.), s. 129(1) and (2)).  \n[104]  Section 138.8(1) of the Ontario Securities Act  provides:  \n138.8  (1) No action may be commenced under section 138.3 without leave \nof the court g ranted upon motion with notice to each defendant.

To meet this threshold, a plaintiff must “offer \nboth a plausible analysis of the a pplicable legislative provisions, and some credible \nevidence in support of the claim” (para. 121, quoting Theratechnologies , at para. 39). \nThis approach “best realizes the legislative intent of the screening mechanism: to \nensure that cases with little chan ce of success — and the time and expense they impose \n— are avoided” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 39).  \n(a) Assessing Whether the Plaintiff Has Made Out a Reasonable Possibility of \nSuccess  \n[107]  In assessing whether the threshold for leave has been met, courts must \n“undertake a reasoned consideration of the evidence to ensure that the action has some \nmerit” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 38). At the same time, a leave motion “should not \nbe treated as a mini -trial” (para. 39); what is required is sufficient credible evid ence to \nshow a reasonable possibility that the plaintiff will succeed at trial:  \nA full analysis of the evidence is unnecessary. If the goal of the screening \nmechanism is to prevent costly strike suits and litigation with little chance \nof success, it follow s that the evidentiary requirements should not be so \nonerous as to essentially replicate the demands of a trial.

[Underlining added; para.  39.] \n[108]  I would unde rscore several points on how courts should apply the test for \nleave and regarding the admonition against lapsing into a “mini -trial”.  \n[109]  First, because the standard on a leave motion under s. 138.8(1) involves a \npreliminary merits test, it is more stringent t han the test for authorization or certification \nof a class action, which was not viewed as sufficiently safeguarding against \nunmeritorious actions regarding the disclosure obligations of securities issuers \n(Theratechnologies , at paras. 35 -36; Green (SCC), at para. 76; Goldsmith v. National \nBank of Canada , 2016 ONCA 22, 128 O.R. (3d) 481, at para. 31; see also Nseir v. \nBarrick Gold Corporation , 2022 QCCA 1718, at para. 40).  \n[110]  Instead, s. 138.8(1) calls for a “qualitative evaluation of the proposed \naction” ( Drywall Acoustic Lathing and Insulation (Pension Fund, Local 675) v. Barrick \nGold Corporation , 2024 ONCA 105, at para. 28). The action must have “more than a \nmere possibility of success” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 4). There must be a \n“reasonable or realist ic chance that the action will succeed” ( Theratechnologies , at \npara. 38, quoted in Green (SCC), at para. 121). This is a “relatively low merits -based \nthreshold” that does not require proof on the balance of probabilities that the action will \nsucceed at tri al (Drywall Acoustic , at para. 37, quoting Mask (C.A.), at para. 45; Nseir , \nat paras. 38 -41). \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n [111]  Second, the plaintiff’s evidence on a leave motion must not only be \n",

In other words, the “evidence \nmust be credible, but even credible evidence may not be sufficient to show that there \nis a realistic or reasonable chance that a claim will succeed” ( Drywall Acoustic , at para. \n30; see also Rahimi v. SouthGobi Resources Ltd. , 2017 ONCA 719, 137 O.R. (3d) 242, \nat para. 38).  \n[112]  The requirement to “undertake a reasoned consideration of the evidence to \nensure that the action has some merit” ( Theratechnologies , at para. 38) inevitably \nrequires a limited weighing of the evidence of both parties ( SouthGobi , at para. 46; \nDrywall Acoustic , at para. 31; Mask (C.A.), at paras. 43 -45; Graaf v. SNC -Lavalin \nGroup Inc. , 2024 QCCA 303, at para. 12). Both the credibility and reliability of the \nevidence must be evaluated on the motion, as aided by any cross -examinations that \nmay have been conducted on affidavits filed ( Drywall Acoustic , at para. 32, citing \nBayens v. Kinross Gold Corporation , 2014 ONCA 901, at paras. 56 and 67; Goldsmith , \nat para.  33).  \n[113]  The motion judge must also consider to some extent the comparative \nstrength of the competing evidence tendered by the parties ( Drywall Acoustic , at para. \n33, citing Nseir , at para. 46; Mask (C.A.), at para. 43). At the same time, a motion judge \nimpr operly lapses into conducting a mini -trial if they attempt “to resolve realistic and \ncontentious issues arising from [the] conflicting credible evidence” ( Drywall Acoustic , \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n at para. 38; see also SouthGobi , at para. 75; Badesha v.

As a result, the court must, to some extent, consider \nevidence that is not before the court. Considering the evidentiary limitations at the leave \nstage is “important because they can work to the prejudice of  plaintiffs who have \npotentially meritorious claims” ( SouthGobi , at para. 48; see also Drywall Acoustic , at \nparas. 35 and 39; Nseir , at para. 43, quoting Amaya , at para. 108).  \n(b) A Plausible Analysis of the Applicable Legislative Provisions Does Not \nEquate to  a Plausible Interpretation of Those Provisions  \n[115]  Both the motion judge and the Court of Appeal read the requirement in \nTheratechnologies  of a “plausible analysis  of the applicable legislative provisions” as \nrequiring a “plausible interpretation ” of the legi slative provisions (emphasis added). \nThis suggested that statutory interpretation is conducted less stringently or in a more \nrelaxed fashion on a motion for leave than at a trial on the merits. The motion judge \nreferred to the need to show “a plausible interpretation  of the Securities Act ” (para. 217 \n(emphasis added)). The Court of Appeal similarly spoke of the plaintiff’s need to show \n“a plausible interpretation  of the Securities Act ” (para. 4 (emphasis added); see also \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n paras. 7 -8",

The Court of Appeal similarly spoke of the plaintiff’s need to show \n“a plausible interpretation  of the Securities Act ” (para. 4 (emphasis added); see also \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n paras. 7 -8), and suggested that the terms “business”, “operations”, and “capital” “have \nnot yet been definitively interpreted in the jurisprudence” (para. 7).  \n[116]  I respectfully disagree with these approaches.  \n[117]  Contrary to the Court of Appeal’s observation, the terms “business”, \n“operations”, an d “capital” have been extensively interpreted in the jurisprudence. The \nissue is not the lack of definitive interpretation or novelty of the terms, but rather that \nthese ordinary business terms acquire meaning by being applied in concrete factual \ncircumsta nces in different industry contexts.  \n[118]  In addition, statutory interpretation is not conducted less stringently on a \nmotion for leave under s. 138.8(1). The interpretation of the provisions at issue must \nstill be correct. Applying a less stringent standard to  the interpretation of a statutory \nterm at this stage of the proceedings would not promote the goal of preventing \nunmeritorious actions from proceeding to trial. Even the respondent acknowledged at \nthe hearing before this Court that there is no room at thi s stage for “watered -down \ninterpretation” (transcript, at p. 90).  \n[119]  Instead, there must be a “plausible analysis”, or a plausible  application , of \nthe relevant legislative provisions, based on the limited evidence available at this early \nstage of the proceedi ngs. A court must evaluate what might qualify as a “material \nchange” on a leave motion — a factually suffused inquiry — with due recognition of \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n the reality that such motions are brought before there has been documentary production \nor oral discovery.  \n(4) Summa ry \n[120]  Section 138.8(1) of the Securities Act  requires a plaintiff to show that “the \naction is being brought in good faith” and that there is “a reasonable possibility that the \naction will be resolved at trial in favour of the plaintiff”. The leave motion invo lves a \npreliminary merits test, but does not require proof on a balance of probabilities that the \naction will succeed at trial. The plaintiff must establish a reasonable or realistic chance, \nand not merely a possibility, that the action will succeed at tri al, based on a plausible \nanalysis of the applicable legislative provisions and some credible evidence in support \nof the claim.  \n[121]  A plausible analysis of the applicable legislative provisions is not simply a \nplausible interpretation of those provisions. Statutory interpretation is not conducted \nless stringently on a leave motion than at trial. Instead, the plaintiff must show a \nplausible application of the relevant legislative provisions, based on the limited \nevidence available at this early stage of the proceedings.  \nC. Application to This Case  \n[122]  There was no dispute before this Court that Mr. Markowich’s action was \nbrought in good faith. Nor was there any dispute that, if Mr. Markowich could establish \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n a reasonable possibility that the pit wall instability or r ockslide resulted in  a “change” \nin Lundin’s business, operations or capital, then there was also a reasonable possibility \nthat any such change was material because it could reasonably be expected to have \naffected Lundin’s stock price. The issue, then, is w hether the motion judge erred in \nfinding that there was no reasonable possibility that Mr. Markowich could establish a \n“change” in Lundin’s “business, operations or capital”.  \n[123]  In my respectful view, the motion judge erred in law in his statutory \ninterpreta tion of what constitutes a “change” in the “business, operations or capital” of \nan issuer. He restrictively interpreted the term “change” based on a dictionary definition \nand the terms “business, operations or capital” based on prior case law. He also erre d \nby applying a line of cases requiring a development to be “important and substantial” \nto constitute a “change” before it must be assessed for materiality.  \n[124]  Based on this erroneous interpretation of “change”, the motion judge ruled \nthat Mr. Markow",

He also erre d \nby applying a line of cases requiring a development to be “important and substantial” \nto constitute a “change” before it must be assessed for materiality.  \n[124]  Based on this erroneous interpretation of “change”, the motion judge ruled \nthat Mr. Markowich coul d not establish that the pit wall instability or rockslide resulted \nin a change in Lundin’s affairs. He found that neither event resulted in a change because \nthey “did not constitute a different position, course, or direction” (para. 179). He ruled \nthat Lu ndin did not “lose the ability to conduct its business” and that the company’s \n“economic viability” was never threatened (paras. 187 -88). He further ruled that \nLundin “engaged in the same operations at the Candelaria mine after the events”, with \nsome modif ications, but that there was no evidence that either event “ever raised any \nconcerns that Lundin could not carry out its operations at the Candelaria mine” (para. \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n \n 189). Finally, the motion judge ruled that not every event that requires an additional \nexpend iture “constitutes a material change to capital and requires a running \ncommentary to investors” (para. 190). With respect, however, none of these elements \nis required to constitute a material change.  \n[125]  I agree with the Court of Appeal that, had the motion j udge correctly \ninterpreted a change in business, operations or capital, and applied that interpretation \nto the evidence on the motion, he would have concluded that there was a reasonable \npossibility that Mr. Markowich could show that the pit wall instabili ty and rockslide \nresulted in a change in Lundin’s operations. The motion judge accepted that there was \na reasonable possibility that these events could be shown to be material at trial. \nAlthough there was competing expert evidence about the duration and ex tent of the \nshutdown, the motion judge found that both expert reports were credible and noted that \nit was “not the role of the court on a leave motion to determine which expert evidence \nwill be accepted at trial” (para. 205). Further, Lundin tendered no di rect evidence of \nthe impact of the duration or extent of the shutdown, including whether the remaining \narea of the open pit or underground mines was shut down as a result of the pit wall \ninstability or whether the rockslide affected the other mining activi ties at the Candelaria \nmine. Such evidence, while absent on the motion, would presumably be available at a \nlater stage of the action, after production and discovery. There was also uncontested \nevidence on the motion that the pit wall instability and rocksl ide impacted Lundin’s \noperations by requiring Lundin to revise its production forecasts downward, to use \nlower grade ore for 2019, and to adjust the phasing of the open pit mine.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n \n [126]  Like the Court of Appeal, I therefore conclude that there was a reasonable \npossibility that Mr. Markowich could succeed at trial in showing that there were \nmaterial changes that Lundin should have disclosed forthwith. As a result, Mr. \nMarkowich should have been granted leave under s. 138.8(1) of the Securities Act  to \ncommence an ac tion for the alleged breach of Lundin’s timely disclosure obligations.  \nVII.

Overview  \n[128]  This appeal concerns a distinction at the heart of the securities disclosure \nregime shared throughout Canada: the difference between a “material fact” and a \n“material change”. This distinction, as my colleague rightly notes, has caused and \ncontinues to cause “considerable uncertainty” and “considerable confusion” (para.  47). \nThis appeal is an opportunity to bring much -needed certainty and clarity for securities \nissuers, investors, of ficers, directors, courts, and tribunals alike. Indeed, clear and \npredictable rules in securities law are needed to render Canada attractive for investors.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n \n [129]  However, the expansive interpretation of “material change” adopted by the \nCourt of Appeal for Ontari o and upheld by my colleague provides little clarity, \nconflates the careful distinction drawn by the legislature between “material fact” and \n“material change”, and invites over -disclosure and premature disclosure from issuers \nseeking to inoculate themselve s from increased liability. This approach serves neither \nissuers nor investors and undermines the core aims and objectives of securities \nregulation in Canada.  \n[130]  Securities law has evolved significantly over the past half century in \nresponse to the growth of the economy, technological advances, the globalization of \ncapital, the diversification of financial instruments, and the increased participation of a \nbroader and more varied investor base (Rt.  Hon.  D. Johnston, K.  D. Rockwell and \nL. Levine, Canadian Securi ties Regulation  (6th. 2025), at ¶1.1) . In Ontario, this \nevolution is reflected in the Securities  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.  S.5 (“Act”), a detailed and \ncarefully constructed legislative framework aimed at protecting investors while \npromoting the integrity and ef ficiency of capital markets in the province . Similar  \nlegislation  has been  adopted  in each province  and territory.  \n[131]  An essential part of the Act is its disclosure regime, which creates both \nperiodic and immediate disclosure obligations for issuers and a statutory cause of action \nagainst issuers and their officers and directors when investors suffer loss as a result of \nthe issuer’s failure to make proper disclosure. This regime is premised on the idea that \ntimely and accurate information is the foundation of fair and efficient capital markets. \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n \n It serves to reduce information asymmetries between issuers and investors, which in \nturn promotes investor confidence, facilitates informed decision -making, and allows \nfor efficient capital markets.  \n[132]  Yet the disclosure  obligations imposed by the Act are not without limits. \nInstead, they hinge on a carefully drawn distinction between a “material fact” and a \n“material change”.

Issuers are obliged to disclose the former periodically, and the latter \nforthwith or immediately . This distinction is not incidental; it reflects a considered \nlegislative choice aimed at ensuring that disclosure obligations are meaningful, \nappropriately calibrated to the nature of the information and the context in which they \narise, and proportionate  — responsive to the informational needs of investors, without \nimposing undue burdens on issuers or disrupting market stability.  \n[133]  The approach taken by the Court of Appeal  — and now endorsed by my \ncolleague  — effectively conflates that legislative distincti on. While my colleague \nacknowledges that “material fact” is defined more broadly than “material change”, he \nadopts an interpretation that makes this a distinction without a difference, imposes a \ndisclosure standard that is broader and more onerous than the  one that the statute \ncontemplates, and undermines the balance that the legislature struck between market \ntransparency and regulatory burden. With respect, the generous and flexible approach \nof the Court of Appeal  — which is adopted by my colleague  — strips “material \nchange” of any meaning that would distinguish it from “material fact”.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n \n [134]  This conflation will have far -reaching impacts. Expanding the scope of \nimmediate disclosure presents risks for investors, issuers, and directors and officers. \nInvestors will  be subject to over -disclosure or premature disclosure, which could flood \nthe market with unnecessary or misleading information. Under my colleague’s \ninterpretation, issuers will now have to assess all events that affect them for materiality \nand potential immediate disclosure, resulting in greater compliance costs which will \nlikely be passed on to investors. At the same time, directors and officers will face \nheightened liability risks. Not only may this deter people from stepping forward into \nthese roles, b ut, as pointed out by the intervener the Insurance Bureau of Canada, it \ncould also result in director and officer insurance being less available and more \nexpensive. These greater compliance and insurance costs will ultimately be borne by \nshareholders and i nvestors, whether through reduced returns, constrained market \nparticipation, or higher barriers to entry  — all of which erode the very market \nefficiency and investor confidence that the Act is designed to protect.  \n[135]  In my view, it is clear that in drawing th e distinction it did between \n“material fact” and “material change”, the legislature intended to oblige issuers to \nassess only changes that alter the nature of the issuer’s business, operations, or capital, \nunderstood at a high level of generality, for mate riality and potential disclosure. This \naccords with the motion judge’s understanding that a “change” requires a change “in \nposition, course or direction” and that the phrase “business, operations or capital” refers \nto “what the company does”, “the activiti es conducted by the company to engage in its \nlines of ‘business’”, or the issuer’s “share structure and rights of shareholders” (2022 \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n \n ONSC 81, at paras.  153-58 and 169). This approach provides clarity and predictability \nfor issuers and investors, and it pr ovides guidance to courts and tribunals. It does so \nwhile maintaining the balance struck by the legislature between disclosure and \nregulatory burden, without sacrificing the flexibility needed to address the myriad \ncircumstances that may arise in the secur ities industry.  \n[136]  Using this approach, the motion judge concluded that there was no \nreasonable possibility that the respondent, Dov  Markowich, could successfully show \nthat the appellant Lundin Mining Corporation experienced material changes when it \ndetected pit wall instability and then suffered a rock slide at one of its mines that \ndelayed approximately 5 percent of its production for roughly a year. The motion judge \ntherefore denied Mr.  Markowich’s motion for leave to bring an action against Lundin \nMining f or failing to immediately disclose those events.  \n[137]  By contrast, the Court of Appeal held, and my colleague affirms, that a \n“change” to an issuer",

The motion judge \ntherefore denied Mr.  Markowich’s motion for leave to bring an action against Lundin \nMining f or failing to immediately disclose those events.  \n[137]  By contrast, the Court of Appeal held, and my colleague affirms, that a \n“change” to an issuer’s business, operations, or capital that must be assessed for \nmateriality, and potentially be immediately disclose d, is anything that is not an \n“external” fact or an “unexplained change in results” (2023 ONCA 359, 166 O.R. (3d) \n732, at para.  82). As Favreau  J.A. stated, writing for the court, and as my colleague \nsupports: “.  . . a change is a change .  . .” (para.  82; Jamal  J.’s reasons, at para.  64). This \nperhaps tautological understanding of “change” is being paired with a broad \ninterpretation of “business, operations or capital” as undefined but “widely understood \ncommercial concepts”, leading to the conclusion that Mr. Markowich made a plausible \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n \n case that the pit wall instability and rock slide were material changes that Lundin \nMining was required to immediately disclose (Jamal  J.’s reasons, at para.  92). \n[138]  In rejecting the motion judge’s approach, my colleague refers to what he \nsays is the motion judge’s “narro[w]” or “restrictive” interpretation of material change \n(paras.  26 and 88 -89). I do not accept this characterization. On the contrary, the motion \njudge’s interpretation is true to the meaning of the phrase “a cha nge in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer” (s.  1(1) “material change” of the Act) and better \nrespects the legislature’s policy choice not to require immediate disclosure of every \nevent that could reasonably impact the issuer’s share price. I  find that the motion \njudge’s interpretation is correct and provides valuable guidance in a fraught area of the \nlaw. \n[139]  This appeal also relates to the standard to be met for granting leave to a \nplaintiff who argues that an issuer has failed to immediately di sclose a material change. \nIn particular, it raises the question of whether the leave requirement modifies or lessens \nthe burden to establish a “material change”, as suggested by the Court of Appeal. On \nthis point, for the reasons I outline below, I agree w ith my colleague that the definition \nof “material change” remains static at all stages of litigation.  \n[140]  I would restore the motion judge’s order denying Mr.  Markowich’s motion \nfor leave to bring the action against Lundin Mining and its directors and officers . \nII. Facts  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n \n [141]  Lundin Mining is a multinational mining corporation incorporated in \nCanada. It is headquartered in Canada but has offices in multiple locations on several \ncontinents. It describes itself as a “diversified Canadian base metals mining company \nwith op erations in Chile, the USA, Portugal, and Sweden, primarily producing copper, \nnickel and zinc” (motion judge reasons, at para.  43). \n[142]  Lundin Mining jointly owns the Candelaria mining complex in Chile with \nSumitomo Corporation. Lundin Mining owns 80 percent o f Candelaria while \nSumitomo owns 20 percent. Candelaria consists of an open pit mine and three \nunderground mines, which provide copper ore to an on -site concentrator and a \nprocessing plant. The mining plan for Candelaria contemplated that the open pit woul d \nbe mined in several phases over a 19 -year lifespan. In 2017, there were five remaining \nphases (Phases  9-13).

    "text": " \nPhase  9 and parts of Phase  10. \n[143]  On or about October  25, 2017, Lundin Mining detected pit w all instability \nin a localized area of the Candelaria mine arising from a wedge of unstable waste \nmaterial (“pit wall instability”). On or about October  31, 2017, the wedge failed and an \nestimated 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of waste material from Phase  10 of the Candelaria \nmine moved downslope, restricting access to Phase  9 (“rock slide”).  \n[144]  The respondent, Mr.  Markowich, is a Toronto -based businessman who \npurchased 10,000 shares of Lundin Mining between November 15,  2017 and \nNovember 27,  2017. He purchased th ose shares at an average price of $9.156 per share, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n \n for a cost of $91,560, plus commissions. Mr.  Markowich did not sell any of his \nsecurities during that period and continued to own them at the time the motion judge \nwrote his decision.  \n[145]  On November  29, 2017 , roughly a month after the above -described events, \nLundin Mining issued a news release advising investors of the pit wall instability and \nthe rock slide, in accordance with its usual practice of releasing operational updates in \nlate November or early Dece mber each year. The news release also detailed revised \nexpectations for production, cash costs, and capital expenditures, as well as a 10 -year \nforecast for Candelaria.  \n[146]  The day after Lundin Mining disclosed the pit wall instability and the rock \nslide, its s hares on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed at $7.52, a decline of $1.44, or \n16 percent from the closing price of $8.96 on November  29, 2017. This one -day drop \nrepresented a loss of over $1  billion of market capitalization.  \n[147]  On the same day, pursuant to Nati onal Instrument 43 -101, Standards of \nDisclosure for Mineral Projects  (2001), 24 OSCB 304, Lundin Mining delivered a \ntechnical report in which its consultant reviewed the pit wall instability and the rock \nslide and discussed planned resequencing for the min ing operations. Two days after the \nnews release, on December 1,  2017, the CEO of Lundin Mining and the Candelaria \nmine’s president and managing director hosted a joint conference call to update \ninvestors on the pit wall instability and rock slide.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n \n [148]  Followin g these events, Mr.  Markowich, as a shareholder of Lundin \nMining, sought leave under s.  138.8 of the Act to bring a statutory claim against Lundin \nMining, and its officers and directors, for Lundin Mining’s alleged failure to make \ntimely disclosure of eith er the pit wall instability or the subsequent rockslide as a \n“material change” that had to be disclosed forthwith, that is, immediately. He also \nsought to certify the action as a class action under s.  5 of the Class Proceedings Act, \n1992 , S.O. 1992, c.  6, advancing claims on behalf of certain shareholders of Lundin \nMining under the statutory cause of action and the common law of negligent \nmisrepresentation. This latter matter is not before our Court, so I will focus only on the \nparts of the decisions below relevant to the matter before us.  \nIII. Judicial History  \nA. Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2022 ONSC 81 (Glustein  J.) \n[149]  The motion judge dismissed Mr.  Markowich’s motion for leave to bring \nthe statutory claim, finding that there was no reasonable possibility that  he could \nsucceed in establishing at trial that the pit wall instability or rock slide constituted a \n“change” to Lundin Mining’s “business, operations or capital” as required by ss.  1(1) \nand 138.8 of the Act.  \n[150]  In arriving at this conclusion, the motion judg e considered the guidance of \nour Court in Theratechnologies inc. v. 121851 Canada inc. , 2015 SCC 18, [2015] 2 \nS.C.R. 106,  and other jurisprudence of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which \n2025 SCC ",

    "text": " required by ss.  1(1) \nand 138.8 of the Act.  \n[150]  In arriving at this conclusion, the motion judg e considered the guidance of \nour Court in Theratechnologies inc. v. 121851 Canada inc. , 2015 SCC 18, [2015] 2 \nS.C.R. 106,  and other jurisprudence of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n \n detailed the principles and factors a motion judge ought to co nsider in these motions. \nThese included the need to bear the following in mind: the relatively low threshold and \nlimits of the record at the leave stage; what evidence is not before the court; and the \nimportance of not engaging in a finely calibrated weigh ing process or resolving \nconflicts in expert evidence unless it could be established that there would be no \nreasonable possibility that an expert’s opinion would be accepted by a trial judge.  \n[151]  The motion judge confirmed that Lundin Mining was both a “report ing \nissuer” and a “responsible issuer” as defined in ss.  1(1) and 138.1 of the Act, meaning \nthat it had a statutory obligation to make “timely disclosure” of “material changes” \nunder s.  75(1) of the Act (paras.  129-30). He noted that, in the context of a s tatutory \nclaim under s.  138.3, Lundin Mining and the individual appellants could be liable for a \nfailure to make timely disclosure set out in s.  138.3(4).  \n[152]  The motion judge then turned to the question of what constitutes a \n“material change”. He noted that s . 1(1) of the Act is clear that there are two \ncomponents to a material change  — the first being the need for a change  to occur in \nthe issuer’s “business, operations or capital”, and the second being the materiality of \nthat change. He also pointed out the a bsence of a statutory definition for “change”, as \nwell as for “business, operations or capital”. In the absence of these key definitions, the \nmotion judge engaged in an exercise of statutory interpretation.  \n[153]  He reviewed the case law on “material change” and  extracted applicable \nprinciples. First, he remarked that the distinction between a material change and a \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n \n material fact is “deliberate and policy -based”, and, in his view, courts must not conflate \nthe two concepts (para.  139). To support this conclusion, h e drew on the discussion of \nBinnie  J. on the same point in our Court’s decision in Kerr v. Danier Leather Inc. , 2007 \nSCC 44, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331, and quoted the remarks of Strathy  J. (as he then was) in \nGreen v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , 2012 ONS C 3637, 29 C.P.C. (7th) \n225, and of Perell  J. in Peters v. SNC -Lavalin Group Inc. , 2021 ONSC 5021. The \nmotion judge concluded at para.  143: \nConsequently, if a development is material and causes a change in the \nbusiness, operations or capital, it must be disclosed immediately. If the \ndevelopment is material and affects a company’s business, operations or \ncapital without resulting in a change, it is a material fact to be disclosed in \nthe ordinary course of periodic disclosure.  \n[154]  Second, relying on Peters and the sources it cited, he noted that there is no \nbright line test for change. Instead, this assessment is a fact -specific inquiry that will \ndepend on the circumstances and events of each given case.  \n[155]  Third, again relying on Peters , the motion judge acknowledged that the \nmarket impact of an event, or its materiality, is not determinative of change. Such an \nunderstanding would be inconsistent with Theratechnologies ’ exhortation against \nreasoning backwards from a market impact to a mate rial change. The motion judge \nmade the point that while materiality and share value can be relevant to the question of \nwhether a “change” has occurred, value volatility will not be determinative.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n \n [156]  In addition to these specific guideposts, the motion judge a dopted a number \n",

Ct.)) . At \nparagraph  161, he adopted the following principles:  \n(i) “[A] supercritical interpret ation of the meaning of material change \ndoes not support the goal of promoting disclosure or protecting the \ninvesting public”: at para.  48; \n \n(ii) “[A] technical interpretation of the language of the [ Securities Act ] \nshould not be relied upon to justify non -disclosure of material \nchanges”: at para.  48; \n \n(iii) “[I]f the decision is borderline, then the information should be \nconsidered material and disclosed”: at para.  48; \n \n(iv) “No single factor will be determinative of whether a material \nchange occurred”: at para.  51; \n \n(v) Mana gement’s subjectively optimistic hopes or attempts to \nmitigate the issue do not alleviate the requirement for immediate \ndisclosure of an otherwise objectively -determined material change: \nat para.  55; \n \n(vi) It is important “to recognize the dangers of hindsight in coming to \nthis conclusion and to be careful not to look at the situation based \non what subsequently happened”: at para.  49; and  \n \n(vii) If a “business managed to continue [its operations] in a lesser form, \ndespite these changes” it “does not detract from” the reality that a \n“material change” still occurred: at para.  116. [Citations omitted.]  \n[157]  In the absence of a statutory definition of “change”, the motion judge \nturned to its grammatical definition. He held that “a change will occur in the context of \ns. 1(1) and  the disclosure obligations under s.  75(1) upon [the issuer taking] ‘a different \nposition, course, or direction’” (para.  150, quoting the Merriam -Webster Dictionary  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n \n (online) definition of “change”). From his perspective, this definition maintained the \ndistinction between a material change and a material fact “without requiring ‘a running \ncommentary on the company’s progress during the quarter or to comment on internal \nor external events that may impact performance’” (para.  150, quoting Green , at \npara.  28). He also differentiated between events that affect the company, as opposed to \nevents that drive a change in the company’s business, operations, or capital.  \n[158]  While some case law, such as Green  and Mask v. Silvercorp Metals Inc. , \n2015 ONSC 5348, aff’d 2016 ONC A 641, 132 O.R. (3d) 161, held that the “change” \nhad to be “substantial” or “important”, the motion judge did not expressly adopt that \nstandard. Instead, he stated that “the key conclusion from both Green . . . and Mask is \nthat a change occurs when the eve nt results in a different position, course, or direction \nto a company’s business, operations, or capital. Otherwise, the distinction between \nmaterial change and material fact would be lost” (para.  151).  \n[159]  In the absence of a statutory definition of “business , operations or capital”, \nthe motion judge provided definitions of each word. Concerning the word “business”, \nhe noted that it has been described in case law as “the lines or activities in which the \nissuer engages to generate revenues” (para.  153). He summ arized the term’s meaning \nas “describ[ing] what the company does” (para.  154).  \n[160]  As regards the term “operations”, he considered a Commission decision \nthat held that the meaning of operations was “where” the company conducted business, \nbut he provided his ow n summary at para.  156: \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n \n Put differently, the term “",

If a \ncompany changes its position, course or direction as to how or where it \nconducts business,  it may be considered a change to “operations”.  \n[161]  Regarding “capital”, the motion judge rejected a suggestion by \nMr. Markowich that, because the statute formerly read “business, operations, assets or \nownership of the issuer”, the meaning of capital should be  defined to include both assets \nand ownership (para.  157). He found this “broad interpretation” to be “inconsistent \nwith the ordinary meaning of the ‘capital’ of a corporation, which refers to its share \nstructure and rights of shareholders” (para.  158).  \n[162]  Applying these interpretations of the Act, the motion judge found that \nMr. Markowich did not satisfy the court that he had a reasonable possibility of \nestablishing at trial that a “change” had occurred to Lundin Mining’s “business, \noperations or capital” as a result of the pit wall instability or the rock slide, based on \ncredible evidence and a plausible interpretation of the Act.  \n[163]  The motion judge noted that there was no evidence that the events changed \nLundin Mining’s “lines of business, how it conducted its  operations, or its capital \nstructure” (para.  29). Because he found that Lundin Mining had already, before the \nevents took place, planned a resequencing of its mining operations that would have \nreduced its annual production, the “only effect” of the events  was that 15,200 tonnes of \ncopper mining would be deferred until 2020 or 2021. This, he found, represented a \ndeferral of less than 5 percent of Lundin Mining’s annual production. In his view, this \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n \n did not constitute a change in its business, operations, or  capital because Lundin Mining \ncontinued to engage in copper mining and “did not lose the ability to conduct its \nbusiness” (para.  187). He further stated, at para.  174: \nThere was no evidence that either the Pit Wall Instability or the Rock \nSlide raised any  threat to Lundin [Mining]’s economic viability, as \nacknowledged by Thomas on cross -examination. At all times, Lundin \n[Mining] was able to continue its business, operations and capital as a \nworldwide mining corporation.  \n[164]  The motion judge, on the evidence, c ould not ascertain whether or not a \nshutdown had occurred following the events. However, he found that even assuming \nthat there was such a shutdown, it would “not assist the court in finding that there was \na change to Lundin [Mining]’s operations” (para.  181). \n[165]  The motion judge also took note of the “inherent risks in open pit mining” \n(para.  179), including pit wall instability and rock slides. In his view, the evidence \ndemonstrated that “Lundin [Mining] managed those risks with advanced ground radar \ntechnol ogy and operated its business under those risks” (para.  179). He noted that \n“routine disclosure of the generic risk of pit wall instability or rock slides .  . . [did] not \ninoculate Lundin [Mining] from disclosure” of a particular event if it constituted a \nmaterial change, but, in his view, the realization of those inherent risks in this instance \n“may have been a material fact . . . but there is no evidence to support that either of the \nevents was a material change  to Lundin [Mining]’s business, operations, or capital. It \ndid not constitute a different position, course, or direction” (paras.  179 and 186 \n(emphasis in original)).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n \n [166]  The motion judge further dismissed the argument advanced by \nMr. Markowich that the increased costs incurred by Lundin Mining associat ed with the \nrock slide were a",

Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2023 ONCA 359, 166 O.R. (3d) 732 (Favreau  J.A., \nSimmons and Benotto  JJ.A. Concurring)  \n[168]  Favreau  J.A. concluded for the court that the motion judge erred in his \napplication of the test for leave and in his interpretation of the words “change”, \n“business”, “operations”, and “capital” by giving them an overly narrow interpretation,  \n“especially in the context of a motion for leave” (paras.  7 and 38). She found that, at \nthe leave stage, Mr.  Markowich was required merely to demonstrate that he had a \n“reasonable possibility of success based on a plausible interpretation of the statute a nd \nthe evidence” (para.  7). The motion judge was said to have further erred by applying \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n \n that restrictive interpretation of the words at issue to the limited evidence available at \nthe leave stage of the proceedings.  \n[169]  She concluded that, when “a more generous  interpretation” of the words of \nthe statute is adopted and applied to the available evidence, it is clear that the motion \njudge ought to have found that Mr.  Markowich had put forward a plausible \ninterpretation and sufficient evidence to support granting l eave to proceed with the \nstatutory cause of action (paras.  8 and 38).  \n[170]  Concerning the motion judge’s definition of “change” as being a “different \nposition, course, or direction”, Favreau  J.A. found that it “[n]otably” derives from a \ndefinition of “change” i n the online version of the Merriam -Webster Dictionary  and \nthat he did not refer to “any case law interpreting the definition of ‘material change’ in \nthe Securities Act , nor [did] he provide any rationale for adopting this definition of \n‘change’ in the con text of the Securities Act ” (para.  59). \n[171]  Favreau  J.A. found the motion judge’s interpretation of “change in the \nbusiness, operations or capital of the issuer” to be inconsistent with existing case law \nand the purpose of the Act.  She emphasized that on a mot ion for leave, when it comes \nto the “legal foundation for the claim, the court is only to consider whether the plaintiff \nhas put forward a ‘plausible’ interpretation of the statute” (para.  67, quoting \nTheratechnologies , at para.  39). By adopting a definiti ve interpretation of the terms, \nthe motion judge erred. She further found that the motion judge’s interpretation was \ninconsistent with other cases and “overly restrictive” (para.  72). \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n \n [172]  Favreau  J.A. also took issue with what she saw as the motion judge \nimpor ting consideration of the magnitude of a change into the determination of what \nconstitutes a “material change”. To this, she stated that  \nthe distinction between material change and material fact does not focus \non the magnitude of the change but, rather, on  whether the change was \nexternal  to the company as opposed to whether the change was in the  \nbusiness, operations or capital of the company. Consideration of the \nmagnitude or significance of the change arises in the second part of the \ndefinition of “",

Consideration of the \nmagnitude or significance of the change arises in the second part of the \ndefinition of “materia l change”, where the issue is whether the change \nwould reasonably be expected to have a significant  effect on stock prices. \n[Emphasis in original; para.  68.] \n[173]  In her view, the motion judge’s reliance on our Court’s decision in Kerr \ndid not properly account for the “primary constraint which Kerr imposed on the \ndefinition of ‘change’”, which was that “it could not be external to the corporation” \n(para.  72). She held that the motion judge erred in his reliance on Rex Diamond Mining \nCorporation  (2008), 31 OSCB 8 337, a decision of the Commission affirmed by the \nDivisional Court ( Rex Diamond Mining v. Ontario Securities Commission , 2010 ONSC \n3926 (Div. Ct.)), which held that a final notice to an issuer from the authorities in Sierra \nLeone that its diamond mine leas es would be cancelled if it failed to comply with \ncertain terms was a material change. Favreau  J.A. stated that the motion judge erred in \nholding that Rex Diamond  stands for the proposition that every change in business, \noperations, or capital “must rise t o the level of affecting a company’s ‘ability to conduct \nits business’” (para.  75, quoting motion judge reasons, at para.  187).  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n \n [174]  Contrary to the motion judge’s approach, Favreau  J.A. preferred the “much \nmore expansive definition of ‘change’” (para.  77) provided by Perell  J. in Peters . She \ndrew on his emphasis that the distinction between a “material change” and a “material \nfact” res ts on a desire to prevent issuers from being obliged to report on external \ndevelopments:  \nIn that case, at paras.  151-152, Perell  J. emphasized the distinction between \na material change and a material fact, recognizing that this distinction was \n“a deliberat e and policy -based legislative decision to relieve reporting \nissuers of the obligation to continually interpret external political, \neconomic, and social developments as they affect the affairs of the issuer, \nunless the external change will result in a chan ge in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer, in which case, timely disclosure of the \nchange must be made”. [para.  77] \n[175]  Favreau  J.A. endorsed this “very expansive definition” of “change” \n(para.  78) as being more consistent with the wording of the provision and the guidance \nof our Court in Kerr . The definition provided by Perell  J. is as follows:  \nChange encompasses alteratio n, amendment, conversion, contraction, \ndevelopment, difference, discovery, detection, disruption, divergence, \nexpansion, innovation, makeover, metamorphosis, modernization, \nmodification, renewal, renovation, reversal, revelation, revolution, \ntransition, or  transformation. The opposite of change is constancy, \ncontinuance, endlessness, immutability, permanence, perpetuity, \nprolongation, stability, and the status quo . Common experience reveals \nthat sometimes change in philosophy, physics, and law is incrementa l and \nsometimes change is paradigm shifting. Common experience reveals that \nsometimes change happens instantly and perceptibly and sometimes \nchange happens progressively and imperceptibly until it is perceived by \nsome benchmark of difference.  \n \n(C.A. reason s, at paras.  78-79, quoting Peters , at para.  155.)  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n \n [176]  She stated that she agreed with Perell  J. in Peters  that “a change is a change, \nand it should be defined broadly, especially in the context of a leave motion under \ns. 138.8 of the Securities Act ” (para.  82). \n[177]  The case law, Favreau  J.A. said, makes it clear that the definition of \n“change” was not intended to include consideration of the magnitude of an event, but \nrather its “qualitative nature” (para",

She found his definition to be overly restrictive and stated that \n“operations” “does not refer only to the  location of a business or what the business \nproduces” (para.  83). Instead, a “change in operations may refer to a broad range of \nchanges within a company, including, as here, an interruption in production and a \nchange in scheduling due to an accident or e quipment failure” (para.  83). \n[179]  Applying her interpretation of “change” and “operations”, Favreau  J.A. \nheld that, had the motion judge applied the proper legal test, the available evidence \nwould have led him to conclude there was a reasonable possibility tha t Mr.  Markowich \ncould demonstrate that the pit wall instability and rockslide constituted a change in \nLundin Mining’s operations. She was of the view that there was some evidence that the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n \n open pit mining operation shut down for a period of time, despite co mpeting evidence \non the length and extent of that shutdown. More importantly, there was uncontested \nevidence that as a result of the rockslide, Lundin Mining modified its mining schedule \nand decreased its expected production at Candelaria. Therefore, with the benefit of \nbetter evidence on the immediate aftermath of the events at trial, she concluded that \nthere was a reasonable possibility that Mr.  Markowich could establish that these were \nchanges to Lundin Mining’s operations. Given that materiality was not  a live issue, she \nwas of the view that the hurdle for leave was cleared.  \nIV. Issues  \n[180]  The issues in this appeal are:  \n1. What is a “material change” for the purposes of the Act?  \n2. Should the leave requirement in s.  138.8 of the Act modify or lessen \nthe burden to esta blish a “material change”?  \nV. Analysis  \nA. A “Material Change” Must Be a Change in the Core or High -Level Aspects of \nthe Issuer’s Business, Operations, or Capital  \n[181]  Disclosure obligations are at the heart of securities law, but they are not \nwithout limits. Their sc ope and timing are bounded by concern over the regulatory \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n \n burden that such requirements impose on issuers. Under the Act, the balance between \nmeaningful disclosure and regulatory burden is struck by the distinction between the \nperiodic disclosure of “mater ial facts” and the immediate disclosure of “material \nchanges”.  \n[182]  The Act defines “material change” as “ a change  in the business, operations \nor capital of the issuer that would reasonably be expected to have a significant effect \non the market price or value o f any of the securities of the issuer” (s.  1(1)). By contrast, \na “material fact” is defined more broadly, as simply “ a fact  that would reasonably be \nexpected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the securities” \n(s. 1(1)). While thes e broad statutory definitions are provided, none of the key terms \ninvolved in this case  — “change”, “business”, “operations”, “capital”, or “fact”  — are \ndefined.  \n[183]  To date, courts and securities tribunals have articulated two rival standards \nfor determining whether a “material change” has occurred, and therefore when that \nchange must be immediately disclosed by an issuer. These standards are on display in \nthe instant case. The motion judge interpreted “change” to mean a “different position, \ncourse, or direct",

    "text": " case  — “change”, “business”, “operations”, “capital”, or “fact”  — are \ndefined.  \n[183]  To date, courts and securities tribunals have articulated two rival standards \nfor determining whether a “material change” has occurred, and therefore when that \nchange must be immediately disclosed by an issuer. These standards are on display in \nthe instant case. The motion judge interpreted “change” to mean a “different position, \ncourse, or directi on” (para.  150, quoting the Merriam -Webster  Dictionary  (online) \ndefinition of “change”) and “business, operations or capital” to refer to what I will call \nthe high -level or core elements of an issuer. Favreau  J.A. held  — with the caveat that \nit cannot be e xternal to the issuer  — and my colleague affirms that “a change is a \nchange, and it should be defined broadly” and “business”, “operations”, and “capital” \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n \n should be left judicially undefined (C.A. reasons, at para.  82). Stated otherwise, \naccording to my co lleague (at para.  79), the rival standards require an event to be \nassessed for materiality and potential immediate disclosure either if: (1) the event leads \nto a change in the position, course, or direction of an issuer’s business, operations, or \ncapital u nderstood at a high level or at their core; or (2) the event relates to any aspect \nof an issuer’s broadly defined business, operations, or capital.  \n[184]  At the core of this appeal, then, is which of these two standards is correct. \nMore specifically, when did th e legislature intend an event affecting an issuer to be \nreviewed for materiality and potentially immediately disclosed? With respect for my \ncolleague and the Court of Appeal, I find that a thorough exercise of statutory \ninterpretation  — in which I engage b elow  — makes it clear that the motion judge’s \napproach best accords with the text, context, and purpose of the Act.  \n[185]  Even so, I agree with both of the courts below and with my colleague that \nit is not desirable to attempt to create a bright line test for ma terial change. To decipher \nwhether a “material change” has occurred, the inquiry will always be fact -specific. By \nrejecting overly stringent parameters, we preserve the flexibility that courts require to \nconsider the unique facts of each case. But, flexibi lity need not devolve into ambiguity, \nuncertainty, or disregard for legislative choices  — this benefits neither courts and \ntribunals nor issuers, investors, officers, or directors. As laid out below, when regard is \nhad to the statutory text, context, and p urpose, and when these are viewed alongside \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n \n the existing case law, a manageable set of principles emerges that improves consistency \nand predictability while ensuring that the legislature’s choices are respected.  \n[186]  Before turning to the statutory interpretati on exercise, I want to first \naddress four of those principles, which are in the form of “exclusions” that have \nemerged from the common law and that circumscribe the meaning of “material \nchange”.  \n(1) Four Common Law Exclusions From the Ambit of “Change”  \n[187]  The existing case law can be read to create four “exclusions” for events \naffecting an issuer that do not come within the definition of “change”. Because these \nexclusions apply regardless of the materiality of the event in question, they are very \nuseful for cir cumscribing the meaning of “a change in the business, operations or \ncapital of the issuer” such that, even if the event in question may reasonably be expected \nto have a significant effect on an issuer’s share price, it does not require immediate \ndisclosure . I do not view them as controversial, and I set them out here for analytical \nclarity.  \n(a) External Developments  \n[188]  As both my colleague and Favreau  J.A. note, courts have repeatedly \nadopted an exclusion to the scope of “change” for an “external” fact or change. This \nexclusion is primarily based on the statute’s use of the phrase “ in the  business, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n \n operations or capital of the issuer ” as well as the internally focused words “business, \noperations or capital”.

Courts have held that external facts or changes beyond th e \ncontrol of an issuer that are of a political, economic, or social nature cannot constitute \na material change within the meaning of the Act, unless they actually result in a change \nin an issuer’s business, operations, or capital (Jamal  J.’s reasons, at pa ras. 51-58). \n[189]  This exclusion was recognized by our Court in Kerr , which addressed \nwhether a material change occurred when Danier Leather realized that unusually hot \nweather would result in reduced sales and the company lagging significantly behind its \nsales  projections. In that case, our Court quoted former Commission Chair Peter  J. Dey \nfor the proposition that the definition of material change was, in part, meant to relieve \nissuers of the obligation to account for external factors when considering their \ndisclosure responsibilities. He said the following, which our Court affirmed:  \nThe term “material change” is limited to a change in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer. This is an attempt to relieve reporting \nissuers of the obligation to continua lly interpret external political, \neconomic and social developments as they affect the affairs of the issuer, \nunless the external change will result in a change in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer , in which case, timely disclosure of the \nchange must be made. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]  \n \n(para.  38, quoting Ontario Securities Commission, “Consolidation of \nRemarks of Peter J. Dey Concerning Disclosure Under the Securities Act  \nMade to Securities Lawyers in Calgary and Toronto  on June 7 and 9” \n(1983), 6 O.S.C. Bull.  2361 (“Dey Remarks”), at p.  2368.)  \n[190]  Emphasizing the distinction between external conditions and internal \ndevelopments, our Court noted that Danier Leather’s sales fluctuated in response to a \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n \n factor that was external to it — the weather. It concluded that such external factors do \nnot constitute material changes and the resulting deterioration in intra -quarterly results \nwas not itself a “change” to Danier Leather’s “business, operations or capital”.  \n[191]  The Commission also addressed the exclusion of external facts from the \nmaterial change analysis in Coventree Inc.  (2011), 34 OSCB 10209. In that case, \nCoventree could no longer issue asset -backed commercial paper, which constituted 90 \npercent of its revenue, because of a lack  of liquidity in the market related to the global \neconomic crisis. The Commission held that a material change occurred because \nCoventree became unable to carry on this aspect of its business. Notably, the \nCommission emphasized that, although the global eco nomic crisis was a public \nphenomenon discernible to shareholders, the asset -backed commercial paper  “market \nwas an opaque market about which public shareholders and investors had limited \ninformation” and they “would not have been able to fully assess the e ffects on, and \nconsequences for, Coventree and its business of the events that were unfolding” \n(para.  641 (emphasis deleted)).  \n[192]  While Coventree  acknowledges the external facts exclusion, it differs from \nKerr in two ways: first, the external phenomenon in Coventree  was not readily \ncognizable to the public, unlike the weather pattern in Kerr ; second, the external \nphenomenon in Coventree  did not merely reduce sales but instead rendered the issuer \nunable to carry on its principle business. Both factual elements assisted in finding that \na material change in the issuer had occurred based on external events.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n \n [193]  There are at least two policy rationales for the exclusion of external events. \nFirst, external events are not within the province of the issuer. When external e vents \nexist for all to see, investors included, issuers should not be required to continually \nassess whether they need to make specific disclosure for those facts alone, unless those \nfacts lead to changes in their business, operations, or capital.

When external e vents \nexist for all to see, investors included, issuers should not be required to continually \nassess whether they need to make specific disclosure for those facts alone, unless those \nfacts lead to changes in their business, operations, or capital. M anagers  are often not at \na significant advantage relative to investors in perceiving these developments or their \nlikely implications for corporate performance. These developments are “in the public \ndomain”, and their likely impact is discernible to investors base d on the issuer’s \nexisting disclosure record (J. D. Fraiberg and R. Yalden, “ Kerr v. Danier Leather Inc. : \nDisclosure, Deference and the Duty to Update Forward -Looking Information” (2006), \n43 Can. Bus. L.J.  106, at p.  110). However, as demonstrated in Coven tree, this policy \nrationale for the exclusion for external events is undermined when the external \ndevelopments are unknown to the investor. In such circumstances, reliance on this \nexclusion may be misplaced.  \n[194]  Second, as alluded to in our Court’s statement in Kerr , quoted above, \nreliance on external facts as constituting potential changes would place an unworkable \nand unnecessary burden on issuers. Issuers are constantly bombarded with political, \neconomic, and social ch anges that could, sometimes, reasonably be expected to have a \nsignificant effect on the market price or value of their securities. Having to report on \nall such changes would place an undue burden on issuers and result in a largely \nunnecessary and even coun terproductive flood of information. Limiting reporting to \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n \n those external events that actually result in a change in issuers’ business, operations, or \ncapital reduces this regulatory burden.  \n(b) Fluctuations in Revenue or Production  \n[195]  The second type of change th at is excluded from the scope of “material \nchange” is simple fluctuations in revenue or production. In Kerr , our Court held not \nonly that unusually hot weather leading to reduced sales of leather was not a material \nchange, but also that the resulting reduc tion in sales below projections was not a \nmaterial change. Simply put, the change in results did not emerge from any change in \nDanier Leather’s business, operations, or capital.  \n[196]  The Superior Court reached a similar conclusion in Mask , at para.  57, aff’d \n2016 ONCA 641, 132 O.R. (3d) 161. In that case, Belobaba  J. commented that “[t]he \ncase law is clear that there must be a significant disruption or interference in the \nongoing operation of the business” for it to be considered a “material change” \n(para.  57). For example, a change will occur if it becomes clear that the issuer is “no \nlonger able ‘to carry on its principal business’” (para.  57, quoting Coventree , at \npara.  583). Belobaba  J. found that the mining issuer’s “trend” of mining less profitably \nwas not itself a material change, as it did not threaten the issuer’s ability to carry on its \nprincipal business (paras.  57-58). It amounted to a change in revenue and production, \nnot a material change to the business, operations, or capital of the issuer.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n \n [197]  Favreau  J.A. recognized this distinction in part when she found that a \nchange under s.  1(1) “cannot simply be an unexplained  change in results; rather, it must \nbe a change in the company’s business, operations or capital” (para.  82 (emphasis \nadded)). I do not dis agree with Favreau  J.A.’s statement; however, it is too narrow. \nEven explained  changes in results that do not stem from alterations in an issuer’s \nbusiness, operations, or capital, such as the weather -based reduction in sales in Kerr or \nthe downward trend in Mask , can fall outside the category of “material change”.  \n[198]  This exclusion accords with the statutory language, as neither production \nnor revenue fit neatly into the categories of “business”, “operations”, or “capital”. \nIndeed, the term “capital” is in di rect contrast with the concept of revenue.  \n[199]  There are also strong policy",

All businesses \nconstantly experience such fluctuations. Requiring issuers  to assess whether they must \nimmediately disclose such trends, which are known to dissipate or reverse, would be \nonerous, and the actual disclosure of such trends may often be misleading. In contrast \nwith immediate disclosure, the periodic reporting proces s gives issuers a chance to \nassess what trends can be observed in their results and to understand why those results \noccurred, allowing for higher -quality disclosure (see J.  J. Park, “Insider Trading and \nthe Integrity of Mandatory Disclosure”, [2018] Wis. L . Rev.  1133, at p.  1155). Thus, \nrevenue and production trends and fluctuations, without something more, are precisely \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n \n the type of developments that properly fall within the category of “material facts”, not \n“material changes”.  \n[200]  While my colleague does not f rame it in quite the same way, he does take \nnote of this dynamic at para.  52 of his reasons.  \n(c) Uncertain Internal Developments  \n[201]  The third type of change that may be excluded from the scope of “material \nchange” are uncertain developments in an issuer’s busines s, operations or capital, as \nmy colleague suggests when he states that a “material change generally requires more \nthan mere negotiations or internal deliberations” (heading of para.  59; see also \nparas.  59-62). \n[202]  As the Mining Association of Canada points out , certain internal \ndevelopments will fall into the category of material facts, rather than material \nchanges  — despite objectively involving changes that may reasonably be expected to \nsignificantly influence share price and value. These could include, for e xample, moving \nthrough interim stages of a merger negotiation, having new discussions relating to an \nacquisition, or responding to a take -over bid (I.F., Mining Association of Canada, at \npara.  13, citing Dey Remarks, at p.  2368). Across the various stages of a corporate \ntransaction, the considerations relating to potential disclosure will change. For \nexample,  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n \n [a]t the conclusion of [the planning stage], the corporate officers will have \na pretty good sense of whether the corporate action that is being planne d \nwill or will not be carried through and result in a material change in the \naffairs of the corporation.  \n \nLate in the planning stage the issuer should consider disclosing the \nproposed material change on a confidential basis to the Chairman, Director \nor Dep uty Director, Enforcement of the Commission. [pp.  2363 -64] \n[203]  This reflects an understanding that, in addition to the “internality” \nrequirement, there is also a “certainty” or “maturity” requirement. An internal \ndevelopment must in some sense crystalize befor e it is a “change” that must be assessed \nfor materiality and potentially disclosed (I.F., Mining Association of Canada, at \npara.  13). \n[204]  The requirement for a sufficient degree of certainty is borne out in AiT \nAdvanced Information Technologies Corporation  (2008), 31 OSCB 712, where the \nCommission  held that no material change had yet occurred when a smaller technology \ncompany was negotiating a merger or takeover by a much larger company. Specifically, \nthere was not “sufficient evidence by which the board co uld have concluded that there \nwas a sufficient commitment from the parties to proceed and a substantial likelihood \nthat the transaction would be completed” (para.  6). Thus, the outcomes of the \nnegotiations were “speculative, contingent and surrounded by un certainties” \n(para.  223). In other words, the internal information and events had yet to solidify into \nan actual change in the business, operations, or capital of the issuer.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n \n [205]  The rationale for",

Two principles serve as policy rationales for this exclusion. First, the \n“legitimate corporate interest in confidentiality should be recognized” to enable \ncorporations  to pursue transactions that may result in a material change “without \nrequiring public disclosure of this pursuit until an appropriate point in time” (Dey \nRemarks, at p.  2362). Second, while regulators were traditionally concerned with \nannouncements of mat erial changes being made “too late”, there is a growing \nacknowledgement that “the damage to the marketplace can be equally severe if the \nannouncement of a material change is made prematurely, that is to say, before the \nchange occurred” (p.  2363).  \n(d) Maintenan ce of the Status Quo  \n[206]  The fourth excluded type of change, which is closely related to the \nuncertain developments exclusion, is the exclusion for events  that only result in the \nmaintenance of the status quo for the issuer’s business, operations, or capital. Two \ncases, Theratechnologies  and Peters , demonstrate this point.  \n[207]  In Theratechnologies , at issue was whether the referral of questions by the \nAmerican Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to an expert advisory committee \nregarding potential side effects of t he issuer’s drug constituted a material change. The \nreferred questions were posted on the FDA’s public -facing website. Stock quotation \nenterprises issued press releases stating that use of the drug in question could cause \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n \n unwanted side effects, and the mar ket reacted negatively. Abella  J., writing for the \nCourt, held that the FDA’s question referral was not a material change because the \npotential side effects of the drug had already been disclosed and question referrals \nthemselves are routine in the FDA app roval process. The question referral did not \ndisturb the status quo and, consequently, despite it being an event that resulted in a \nmaterial effect on the value of the issuer’s securities, there was no need for its \nimmediate disclosure.  \n[208]  Similarly, in Peter s, Perell  J. held, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario \nupheld, that SNC -Lavalin Group Inc.’s receipt of a message indicating that it would \nnot be invited to participate in remediation negotiations regarding its alleged illegal \nconduct in Libya was not a ma terial change. That decision was premised on findings \nthat there was never any remediation opportunity extended to SNC before the message \nwas sent, and SNC continued to lobby for remediation opportunities after it received \nthe message. Thus, while the rece ipt of the message was a “change”, broadly \nunderstood, the message also altered nothing of significance in SNC’s business, \noperations, or capital; it simply maintained the status quo. Perell  J. wrote the following \nat para.  161: \nThere never was a sure thing  or a done deal for a Remediation \nAgreement, and the message received by SNC on September  4, 2018 did \nnot change SNC’s prospects of: (a) being convicted and debarred; (b) \nacquitted and not debarred; or (c) being invited to negotiate a Remediation \nAgreement , which was never a sure thing or a done deal. All the message \nof September  4, 2018 did was to maintain the status quo  . . . .

Directrice de la protection de la \njeunesse du CISSS A , 2024 SCC 43 (“ CDPDJ ”), at para.  23: \nIt is well settled that “the words of an Act are to be read in their entire \ncontext and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the \nscheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” \n(E.

As noted by Wagner  C.J. in CDPDJ at \npara.  28, in “the absence of statutory definitions, what should be focused on is the \ngrammatical and ordinary meaning of the text, th at is, ‘the natural meaning’ that \nappears when the provision is simply read through as a whole ( Canadian Pacific Air \nLines Ltd. v. Canadian Air Line Pilots Assn. , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 724, at p.  735, quoted in \nR. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes  (7th ed. 2022), at §  3.02[1]; see also R. v. \nAudet , [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at para.  34)”. Additionally, when setting out to establish \nthe ordinary meaning of a text, the constituents of immediate context can be relied \nupon. This immediate context includes “the sectio n or subsection in which the words \nin question appear” (Sullivan, at §  3.02[2]).  \n[213]  Turning to that text and immediate context, s.  1(1) of the Act defines \n“material change” as follows:  \n“material change”,  \n \n(a) when used in relation to an issuer other than an inves tment fund, \nmeans,  \n \n(i) a change in the business, operations or capital of the issuer \nthat would reasonably be expected to have a significant \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n \n effect on the market price or value of any of the securities of \nthe issuer, or  \n \n(ii) a decision to implement a change  referred to in subclause (i) \nmade by the board of directors  or other persons acting in a \nsimilar capacity or by senior management of the issuer  who \nbelieve that confirmation of the decision by the board of \ndirectors or such other persons acting in a simil ar capacity is \nprobable .  . . . \n[214]  As noted by the motion judge, this definition has two clear components: \nfirst,",

While “mat erial change” is defined, \nthe statute does not further define what constitutes “a change in the business, operations \nor capital of the issuer” as used in subcl.  (a)(i). However, reviewing the text of the \nprovision, I find support for the motion judge’s int erpretation in both subcl.  (a)(i) as \nwell as subcl.  (a)(ii).  \n[215]  To begin, it is clear that the key terms “change”, “business”, “operations”, \nand “capital” cannot be interpreted in isolation; their relationships to each other must \nbe examined. The word “change ” must be read alongside its surrounding text. What the \nlegislature was concerned with was not simply any and all changes to an issuer, but “a \nchange in the business, operations or capital of the issuer”. Therefore, the meaning of \n“change” must be understo od in relation to the terms it acts upon, namely, “business, \noperations or capital”.  \n[216]  These words, too, cannot be understood in isolation. I agree with the \nintervener the Canadian Chamber of Commerce when it suggests that the terms \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n \n “business, operations or capital” ought to be interpreted in accordance with the \n“associated words” rule of statutory interpretation. That rule provides that “a term or \nan expression should not be interpreted without taking the surrounding terms into \naccount” ( Opitz v. Wrzesnewsky j, 2012  SCC  55, [2012]  3 S.C.R.  76, at para.  40). In \nother words, “[t]he meaning of a term is revealed by its association with other terms: it \nis known by its associates” ( Opitz , at para.  40 (emphasis deleted), quoting 2747 -3174 \nQuébec  Inc. v. Quebec (Régie des permis d’alcool) , [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919 , at para.  195).  \n[217]  Considered as a group, the words “in the business, operations or capital of \nthe issuer” plainly signal an aspect of “internality”. That is clear in the jurisprudence \nreviewed above and in the reasons of my colleague. But it would be an error to stop the \nanalysis there. It must also be noted that the legislature chose to use the particular words \n“business, operations or capital”  — words that all suggest a high level of \ngeneralit y — without any indication that alterations to the innumerable factors that \nmight underlie those general terms but that might not themselves lead to changes in \nthose general terms should be considered. The legislature did not indicate that changes \nto these  lower -level factors should be considered, such as providing, for example, that \noperations include interruptions in production or changes in scheduling. Instead, it saw \nfit to use terms that speak to the nature of the issuer at a high level of generality. Put \nanother way, the legislature used words that all relate to the core aspects of an issuer. \nThe use of these terms accords with and signals an intention by the legislature to trigger \na materiality review and potential immediate disclosure for changes to core or \nhigh-level aspects of the issuer’s business, operations, or capital only.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n \n [218]  This textual emphasis on high -level alterations is also signalled in subcl. \n(a)(ii) of the definition of “material change”. That subclause defines the term “material \nchange” to also mean “ a decision to implement a change  referred to in subclause (i) \nmade by the board of directors  or other persons acting in a similar capacity or by senior \nmanagement of the issuer ”. By its emphasis on boards of directors, similarly placed \nindivi duals, or senior management, this statutory language points to the understanding \nthat a “change” is concerned",

    "text": ") of the definition of “material change”. That subclause defines the term “material \nchange” to also mean “ a decision to implement a change  referred to in subclause (i) \nmade by the board of directors  or other persons acting in a similar capacity or by senior \nmanagement of the issuer ”. By its emphasis on boards of directors, similarly placed \nindivi duals, or senior management, this statutory language points to the understanding \nthat a “change” is concerned with the upper levels of corporate decision -making that \nalter the issuer’s business, operations, or capital  — not, for example, low -level \noperatio nal decisions that may affect the scheduling of production at a single place of \nbusiness in a multinational issuer . In doing so, this language sheds light on and \nreinforces the understanding that “a change in the business, operations or capital” in \nsubcl.  (a)(i) relates to the core aspects of the issuer.  \n[219]  My colleague casts doubt on the interpretive value of the use of the word \n“change” in both subcls.  (a)(i) and (a)(ii) (para.  80). In doing so, he overlooks the \nexpress statutory language linking the two sub clauses. In particular, subcl.  (a)(ii) \nexplicitly states that it concerns “a change referred to in subclause  (i)”. Therefore, a \n“change” under subcl.  (a)(i) is the same as a “change” under subcl.  (a)(ii). Because of \nthis, the fact that subcl.  (a)(ii) conce rns only decisions “to implement a change” made \nby a board of directors, persons acting in a similar capacity, or senior management with \nprobable board approval strongly suggests that a “change” under both subclauses \nexcludes minor alterations in the affai rs of the issuer that are beneath the purview of \nthese decision makers. Instead, a “change” under subcl.  (a)(ii) involves high -level \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n \n decision makers and therefore concerns decisions that affect an issuer’s business, \noperations, or capital at their core or at a high level. Finding that a “change” under \nsubcl.  (a)(i) lacks a similar focus on high -level or core elements of an issuer’s business, \noperations, or capital would be an incongruous reading of the legislature’s two \ndefinitions of “material change”.  \n[220]  This level of generality suggests that the change itself must be \nsignificant  — but not in the sense that the change must be of a particular magnitude, \ndegree, or materiality. Rather, the change must be of a particular kind: it must affect \nthe business, operat ions, or capital of an issuer understood at the level of generality that \nthe legislation speaks to.  \n[221]  None of the interpretative analysis above conflicts with the motion judge’s \ninterpretation, and I accept his analysis of the ordinary meaning of the key ter ms at \nplay. In the absence of statutory definitions, and in line with Wagner  C.J.’s exhortation \nin CDPDJ , the motion judge interpreted the term “change” by adopting its ordinary \nand grammatical meaning. He began by referencing the dictionary definition of \n“change”. He held that “change” signifies “a different position, course, or direction” \n(para.  150). In his view, a change that gives rise to an immediate disclosure obligation \nunder the Act occurs when an event alters the trajectory of a company’s business , \noperations, or capital (para.  151).  \n[222]  As with “change”, the motion judge provided his interpretations of \n“business”, “operations”, or “capital” in an effort to resolve the matter before him. \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n \n Drawing on case law, he defined “business” as “the lines or activ ities in which the \nissuer engages to generate revenues”; in other words, he said the term “is used to \ndescribe what the company does” (paras.  153-54). He defined “operations” as being \n“‘where’ the company conducted business”, saying that the term is also u sed “to refer \nto the activities conducted by the company to engage in its lines of ‘business’” \n(paras.  155-56). Concerning “capital”, he found that the ordinary meaning of the word \nrefers to an issuer’s share structure and the rights of an issuer’s shareho lders \n(paras",

He defined “operations” as being \n“‘where’ the company conducted business”, saying that the term is also u sed “to refer \nto the activities conducted by the company to engage in its lines of ‘business’” \n(paras.  155-56). Concerning “capital”, he found that the ordinary meaning of the word \nrefers to an issuer’s share structure and the rights of an issuer’s shareho lders \n(paras.  153-59). These interpretations, too, accord with the legislature’s focus on \nunderstanding business, operations, and capital at a high level of generality, as \nevidenced by both the general words chosen and their association with other terms.  \n[223]  In addition, I see nothing improper with the motion judge’s use of the \ndictionary definition of “change”. I take no issue with my colleague’s statement that \ndictionary definitions are not determinative in exercises of statutory interpretation and \nthat they indeed must be approached with caution (paras.  66-69). Dictionary definitions \ncannot be relied on to the exclusion of the proper method for conducting statutory \ninterpretation and the use of its principles.  \n[224]  However, the motion judge did not improperly rely  on the dictionary \ndefinition of “change”. Rather, the definition he found was tested against, and \nsupported by, his assessment of the purpose of the statute and legislative intent. The \nmotion judge’s brief subsection dealing with the interpretation of “ch ange” follows, \nand was clearly informed by, his extensive discussion of the applicable statutory \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n \n framework and legislative intent (paras.  128-43). In his analysis of “change”, the \nmotion judge laid out opposing definitions of “change” that emerged from the  case law \nand from the parties (paras.  148-49). He referred back to his prior discussion, noting \nthat the dictionary definition of “change” he found “maintains the distinction between \na material change and material fact, without requiring ‘a running commen tary on the \ncompany’s progress during the quarter or to comment on internal or external events \nthat may impact performance’” (para.  150).  \n[225]  Read as a whole, the motion judge’s reasons disclose that he found a \ndictionary definition that usefully encapsulated the ordinary meaning of the term \n“change” as informed by the legislature’s intent, derived from the distinction between \n“material fact” and “material change”, and the jurisprudence on the disclosure \nrequirements under the Act. The motion judge did not abro gate his duty to interpret the \nAct in favour of relying on a dictionary definition. Rather, in conducting his \ninterpretation, he found that a particular dictionary definition provided a valuable \narticulation of legislative intent. I see no error there.  \n(b) The Context and Purpose of the Act Support the Interpretation That a \n“Material Change” Must Be More Than a Mere Event Affecting an \nIssuer’s Affairs  \n[226]  The motion judge’s interpretation finds additional support in the broader \ncontext and purpose of the Act. In pa rticular, his interpretation accords with the \nlegislature’s deliberate distinction between “material change” and “material fact”, the \nvarious policy considerations underlying that distinction, and the purposes that underlie \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n \n the Act’s disclosure regime. To find otherwise conflates the two terms, imposing a \nmore onerous standard of immediate disclosure on issuers than the statute \ncontemplates, undermining the careful balance the legislature has struck between \nmarket transparency and regulatory burden, and fos tering further confusion around the \ndisclosure obligations of issuers.  \n(i) The Deliberate Legislative Distinction Between “Material Fact” and \n“Material Change” Must Be Respected  \n[227]  Although disclosure is vital for Canadian securities markets, law, and \npractice, d isclosure obligations are not without limits. The questions of what must be \ndisclosed, and when, involve delicate policy decisions and trade -offs. These different \nconsiderations and varied interests taken into account in crafting the Act’s disclosure \nregim e are evidenced in s.  1.1, which lists the Act’s purposes as follows:  \n(a) to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or \nfraudulent practices;  \n \n(b) to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and \nconfidence in capital markets;  \n \n(b.1)  to foster capital formation; and  \n \n(c) to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the \nreduction of systemic risk.  \n[228]  My colleague acknowledges these",

Yet he places a near singular focus on investor \nprotection and the objective of remedying infor mational asymmetry (paras.  6, 36, 58, \n60, 63, 72, 84, 95 and 99). However, investor protection and the remedying of \ninformational asymmetry do not exclusively favour a low threshold for disclosure. One \nmust not ignore that too much disclosure can also be p rejudicial to investors. As the \ncourt in Cornish  noted at para.  41, quoting the Supreme Court of the United States in \nTSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc. , 426 U.S. 438 (1976), “[s]ome information is of \nsuch dubious significance that insistence on its di sclosure may accomplish more harm \nthan good” (p.  448).  \n[229]  Moreover, and with respect, investor protection, while important, does not \noverride the other objectives of the Act. It is true that our Court has recognized that the \nAct is remedial in nature, but we have also recognized that securities regulation seeks \nto balance “the needs of the investor community against the burden imposed on \nissuers”; ultimately, the degree to which a bargain is struck between the two is a \nfunction, as Binnie  J. wrote, of legislat ive policy and choice ( Kerr , at para.  5; see also \nPezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers) , [1994] 2 S.C.R. 557, at p.  589).  \n[230]  The legislature chose to require periodic disclosure of “material facts” and \nimmediate disclosure of “material changes”. Our Court has previously recognized and \ndistinguished between these two types of continuous disclosure obligations:  \nPeriodic disclosure  must be made at regular intervals, typically through the \nregular provision of documents such as proxy circular s, financial \nstatements and insider trading reports. In these regularly issued documents, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n \n companies must disclose all material facts  — that is, anything “that may \nreasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or \nvalue of securitie s issued”: Securities Act (Quebec), s.  5 “material fact”.  \n \nTimely disclosure obligations , on the other hand, are imposed only \nwhen there has been a material change  in the issuer’s affairs. Material \nchanges, which arise from changes in the issuers’ business , operations or \ncapital, must be disclosed at the time they occur: Securities Act  (Quebec), \ns. 5.3; Mark R. Gillen, Securities Regulation in Canada  (3rd ed. 2007), at \np. 211; David Johnston, Kathleen Doyle Rockwell and Cristie Ford: \nCanadian Securities Reg ulation (5th ed. 2014), at p.  249. [Underlining \nadded.]  \n \n(Theratechnologies , at paras.  23-24) \n[231]  Rather than focusing on addressing informational asymmetry alone, the \nlegislature chose to impose balanced disclosure obligations on issuers using the \ndistinction  between “material fact” and “material change”. It chose to require periodic \ndisclosure of “material facts” and immediate disclosure of “material changes”. In doing \nso, the legislature struck a balance between ensuring meaningful investor protection \nand av oiding undue burdens on issuers, thereby crafting a disclosure regime with limits \n(Kerr , at para.  5; Theratechnologies , at para.  55). In Kerr , our Court called that \ndistinction “deliberate and policy -based” (para.  38). \n[232]  Broadly speaking, the distinction is clear.

In Kerr , our Court called that \ndistinction “deliberate and policy -based” (para.  38). \n[232]  Broadly speaking, the distinction is clear. The legislature sought periodic \ndisclosure of a broad array of information affecting an issuer, and immediate disclosure \nof a narrower subset of changes. This is evident in the two legislated definitions in \nquestion. Section 1(1) of the Act defines “material fact” as “a fact that would \nreasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the \nsecurities”. By contrast, material changes are defined only as those “changes” in an \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n \n issuer’s “business, operations or capital” th at are also material. In other words, a \n“material change” is not simply a “material fact”; a material change is more than just a \nnew material fact. It is unquestionable that the legislature intended “material change” \nto have a different meaning than “mater ial fact” ( Pezim , at p.  597; Kerr v. Danier \nLeather Inc. (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para.  53, aff’d 2007 SCC 44, [2007] 3 \nS.C.R. 331; Johnston, Rockwell and Levine, at ¶¶  6.7-6.8). \n[233]  The importance of this distinction has been repeatedly recognized.  Writing \nfor our Court in Theratechnologies , Abella  J. rejected the suggestion that a list of \n“potentially ‘material’ information” provided in a policy document was dispositive of \nthe characterization of material facts and “material changes” (para.  52). Sh e found that \nthe list only dealt “with the market impact of events, not whether they are best \ncharacterized as material facts or material changes”. Therefore, she held that the list \ncould not be adopted precisely because doing so would “collapse the distin ction \nbetween material facts and material changes, significantly expanding timely disclosure \nobligations beyond what is required by statute” (para.  53). Moreover, as our Court \nnoted in Kerr  (at para.  38), the elimination of this distinction was considered and \nrejected in the Toronto Stock Exchange Committee on Corporate Disclosure’s Final \nReport: Responsible Corporate Disclosure: A Search for Balance  (1997 , Thomas I. A. \nAllen, Q.C., Chair ) and Ontario’s Five Year Review Committee Final \nReport  — Reviewing th e Securities Act (Ontario)  (2003, Purdy Crawford, Chair). It is \nnot insignificant that the proposals to collapse the distinction were declined. This is \nparticularly so because, on two occasions, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n \n legislature’s t reatment of those two reports can be taken as persuasive evidence “of the \nlegislature’s intent to distinguish between material changes and material facts, and to \nimpose on issuers a continuous disclosure obligation for the former but not for the \nlatter” ( Kerr, at paras.  119-20, aff’d 2007 SCC 44, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331; see also \nDrywall Acoustic Lathing and Insulation, Local 675 Pension Fund v. Barrick Gold \nCorp. , 2021 ONCA 104, at para.  62). \n[234]  Based on the foregoing, we must be guided by the statute and respect  the \nlegislature’s choice. We must not “collapse the distinction” or “conflate the concepts” \nformed by the legislature. However, this is the result of the Court of Appeal and my \ncolleague’s use of overbroad understandings of the terms “change”, “business”,  \n“operations”, and “capital”. Under their interpretation, almost every “event” that affects \nthe affairs of an issuer will have to be reviewed for materiality and almost every \nanalysis of “material change” will become a question of materiality alone.

Under their interpretation, almost every “event” that affects \nthe affairs of an issuer will have to be reviewed for materiality and almost every \nanalysis of “material change” will become a question of materiality alone. In eff ect, the \nwords “business, operations or capital” are given no meaning, the clear legislated  \ndistinctions are collapsed, and the regulatory burden is increased in a manner that is not \njustified by the text, context, or purpose of the Act.  \n[235]  These impacts can be shown by an assessment of the four exclusions noted \nabove using the interpretations provided by the Court of Appeal and affirmed by my \ncolleague. Their definition of “change” is paired with the understanding that the \nmeanings of “business”, “operations”  or “capital” are less “restrictive” than the motion \njudge’s proposed interpretations. Again, the motion judge’s definitions of “business”, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n \n “operations”, and “capital” were: what the company does; the activities conducted by \nthe company to engage in its li nes of business; and the issuer’s share structure and \nrights of shareholders, respectively.  \n[236]  It is unclear how the exclusions noted above, or the distinction between a \nmaterial fact and a material change more broadly, can survive the expansive definitions \nadopted by the Court of Appeal and affirmed by my colleague. Consider the exclusion \nfor external developments. While external facts and changes are generally excluded \nfrom disclosure, external political, social, and economic developments that actually \nresul t in a change in the business, operations, or capital of the issuer must be \nimmediately disclosed. This is a sensible distinction that aligns with the text of the \ndefinition of “material change”, but my colleague’s interpretation may render it of little \nsubstance.  \n[237]  Under my colleague’s interpretation, it is uncertain when a relevant \nexternal event would not be a change in the issuer’s business, operations, or capital that \nmust be assessed for materiality. Consider the facts in Kerr , a very clear case where \ndisclosure should not be required. In that case, unusually warm weather brought about \na reduction in sales. The weather, an external event, caused an “alteration”, “reversal”, \n“modification”, or “contraction” in Danier Leather’s sales. The weather resulted in a \n“change” in the issuer. That change impacted Danier Leather’s ability to sell its \nproducts. If “business” is defined more broadly than “what the company does” or “the \nactivities conducted by the company to engage in its lines of ‘business’”, it is unc lear \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n \n on what basis the sales reversal or contraction in Kerr would not be a change in Danier \nLeather’s business. Therefore, it would need to be immediately disclosed  — assuming \nmateriality.  \n[238]  The substantive difference between events that merely affect an issuer’s \naffairs and those that constitute or result in a change to an issuer’s business, operations, \nor capital was alluded to by our Court in Kerr : \nThe term “material change” is limited  to a change in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer. This is an attempt to relieve reporting \nissuers of the obligation to continually interpret external political, \neconomic and social developments as they affect the affairs  of the issuer, \nunless  the external change will result in a change in the business, \noperations or capital of the issuer , in which case, timely disclosure of the \nchange must be made. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]  \n \n(Kerr , at para.  38, quoting Dey Remarks.)  \nThis e xcerpt supports the view that the external change exclusion is based on a \ndistinction between “developments as they affect the affairs of the issuer” and \ndevelopments resulting in changes in the “business, operations or capital of the issuer”. \nMere develop ments that affect the affairs  of the issuer are lower -order changes that do \nnot lead to changes  to business, operations, or capital understood at a high level of \ngenerality that must be assessed for materiality.

As noted in Perell  J.’s definition, which was \nadopted by the Court of Appeal in the instant case, change includes an “expansion”, \n“contraction”, or “reversal” and, if the  definition of operations as “the activities \nconducted by a company to engage in its lines of business” is too restrictive, then a \nchange in results or progress from these activities could be characterized as a change \nin the issuer’s operations. Even downw ard trends in production would have to be \nassessed for materiality and, if material, immediately disclosed, as the “discovery” of \nthe trend would mean having knowledge of a “reversal”, “contraction”, or “difference” \nin operations. Thus, alterations in reve nue or production would be changes in the \n“business, operations or capital of the issuer”, and the question would once more \ndevolve to a materiality assessment, again conflating material change and material fact.  \n[240]  Uncertain developments may also constitute a “material change” under the \nexpansive interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal and my colleague. If a change \nincludes a “development” or a “discovery”, then the receipt of initial offers, advances \nor failures in negotiations, or the solidification o f potential transactions could be \nunderstood as “developments” or “discoveries”, that is, changes. If these developments \ngo to a potential capital -changing transaction, it is unclear why disclosure would not \nbe required even before a solidification of the potential transaction in \nquestion  — assuming materiality. The result would be, once more, that the only \nquestion would become whether the development is material.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n \n [241]  Similarly, the exclusion for events that maintain the status quo would be \nunlikely to survive  and serve its purpose of diminishing the regulatory burden on \nissuers. A message confirming that an issuer will not be invited to undertake \nremediation or a series of questions posted publicly by a regulator to the issuer could \nbe characterized as a “deve lopment”. According to my colleague’s approach, these \nwould therefore be changes, and they could affect business and operations and \npotentially require disclosure. Once more, the question of disclosure would collapse to \none of materiality alone.  \n[242]  The above consequences demonstrate the result of favouring an overbroad \ndefinition of “change”, failing to provide any guidance concerning the terms \n“business”, “operations”, and “capital”, and ignoring the legislature’s focus on the \nhigh-level or core aspects of an  issuer. Respectfully, relying on the notion that “a \nchange is a change” and that the terms “business”, “operations” and “capital” are \nbroader than understood by the motion judge is unworkable and does not respect clear \nlegislative intent.  \n[243]  Instead, the wor ds “business”, “operations” and “capital” must be given \nsufficient definitional content to accord with the legislature’s choice of specifying that \nchanges must be in the “business, operations or capital of the issuer”. These words do \nmore than exclude exte rnal events from immediate disclosure requirements. They do \nmore than require that “something” occurred to the issuer that must, if it is material, be \ndisclosed immediately. Such meanings could easily have been achieved by the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n \n legislature by leaving out th e words “business, operations or capital” altogether. \nTherefore, these words must be given meaning. The motion judge’s interpretation does \njust that. By linking “change” to “business, operations or capital”, it properly focuses \non the core aspects or high -level elements of an issuer while excluding consideration \nof external, production or revenue -oriented, uncertain, routine, or ordinary \ndevelopments that do not rise to the level of “changes”.

This accords with the common \nlaw exclusions and with the legisla ture’s emphasis on matters that go to the core of the \nissuer.  \n(ii) Overbroad Disclosure Obligations Run Contrary to the Act’s Delicate \nPolicy Balancing  \n[244]  Conflating “material change” and “material fact” does more than risk \nobscuring legislated distinctions; it ig nores some and may run contrary to others of the \nmany purposes involved in crafting the Act’s disclosure regime. Specifically, it may \nencourage over -disclosure or premature disclosure beyond what is required by the \nstatute, carrying with it an increased re gulatory burden and risks to the efficiency of \ncapital markets. I see this approach leading to negative impacts on investors, issuers, \nand directors and officers that run contrary to the Act’s additional purposes of fostering \nefficient and competitive capi tal markets and capital formation.  \n[245]  Beginning with the impact on issuers, to accept the approach taken by the \nCourt of Appeal  — to essentially invite running materiality analyses for events \naffecting an issuer’s affairs and a running commentary on an issuer ’s material \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n \n facts  — may incentivize issuers to over -disclose or disclose prematurely to mitigate \ncompliance and liability risk. This presents at least two concerns for investors.  \n[246]  First, I agree with the intervener the Canadian Chamber of Commerce that \nthis “market noise” may very well prevent investors from assessing the true character \nand activities of an issuer, valuing its securities, and making informed investment \ndecisions (I.F., at para.  25). Over -disclosure or premature disclosure will result in \nincreased costs in corporate transactions and in raising capital; therefore, capital \nmarkets will become more costly, less efficient, and less competitive. This not only \nruns counter to the Act’s balanced disclosure regime, but also runs against its purposes \nof protecting investors, promoting fair, efficient, and competitive capital markets, and \nstimulating capital formation.  \n[247]  Second, over -disclosure or premature disclosure may also frustrate the goal \nof directing capital to the most deserving issuers. As our Co urt recognized in Kerr , the \nAct’s promotion of fair dealing and capital market efficiency “enhances the pool of \ncapital available to entrepreneurs” (para.  32). My colleague acknowledges the \nrelationship between disclosure and efficiency of capital markets (at para.  37), yet fails \nto engage with the ramifications of over -disclosure or premature disclosure. Requiring \ninvestors to wade through excessive disclosure from issuers seeking to reduce their risk \nof liability because of an overly broad interpretation of “material change” will not assist \ninvestors in identifying and directing that “pool of capital” to the most deserving \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n \n companies. This may stunt efficiency and the allocation of capital within the market, \nultimately reducing overall returns for investors . \n[248]  Issuers will also be required to undertake internal changes that could prove \ncostly to respond to the upholding of the Court of Appeal’s broad interpretation. By \nsuggesting that “a change is a change”, the Court of Appeal effectively renders any \nevent af fecting an issuer’s affairs a trigger for potential disclosure  — leaving only \nmateriality as the remaining threshold. I agree with the intervener the Mining \nAssociation of Canada that this interpretation will require “an issuer to marshal \nresources to deft ly assess the materiality of every change, however minor, from an \naccident to equipment failure”, which “is simply unreasonable and should be resisted \nas an absurd interpretation of the timely disclosure obligation” (I.F., at para.  20). \n[249]  My colleague discou nts the appellant’s warning that adopting the Court of \nAppeal’s expansive interpretation will require issuers to assess every internal \ndevelopment for materiality, asserting that not “every minor internal event” will trigger \ndisclosure as a “material chang e” (para.  78). He suggests that the materiality threshold \nwill screen out trivial changes because “[o]ften, the materiality of a ‘change’ will be \nobvious” (para.  78). With respect, this assurance is unpersuasive.

It fails to contend \nwith the practical cons equences of the expansive definition now \nendorsed  — consequences that the Court of Appeal itself acknowledged, when it \nincluded the possibility that a simple scheduling change caused by equipment failure \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n \n or an accident could successfully trigger the immedi ate disclosure obligations required \nof a material change (see para.  83). \n[250]  Moreover, my colleague’s contention also ignores a further key issue. Not \nonly will it be more likely that issuers will have to report on events whose disclosure \ndoes not conform with  the balancing and purposes intended by the Act, but issuers will \nalso be required to assess every event affecting their affairs for materiality, with the \nphrase “a change in the business, operations or capital” playing almost no part in \nconstraining their  potential disclosure requirements.  \n[251]  Requiring an issuer’s senior management to assess the materiality of every \nevent that affects their affairs and the potential need to immediately disclose each event \nis not practicable, nor is it just when civil liabilit y may follow from a failure to disclose. \nIt also undermines the purposes of the Act, because the added resource strain on issuers \nwill result in greater compliance costs, diverting attention from substantive governance, \ndiscouraging participation in public  markets, and ultimately impairing market \nefficiency and investor confidence.  \n[252]  My colleague disagrees with this concern about the liability of issuers, \nofficers, and directors. He argues that their liability is unaffected by his interpretation \nbecause it “r eflects the legal status quo arising from several judgments of this Court \nsuch as Pezim , Kerr , and Theratechnologies ” (para.  84). With respect, this is simply \nnot the case. Neither Pezim , nor Kerr , nor Theratechnologies  holds that my colleague’s \ninterpreta tion applies. Instead, the case law is in conflict as to when an event constitutes \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n \n a “material change” and therefore when issuers, their officers, or their directors may be \nliable for failure to immediately disclose that event. Recognizing a broad and unde fined \nstandard for immediate disclosure will dramatically expand the disclosure requirement, \nand with it, potential liability for non -disclosure.  \n[253]  Finally, directors and officers will be impacted by excessive disclosure \nobligations in at least two ways.  \n[254]  First, as argued by the intervener the Insurance Bureau of Canada, adopting \nthe Court of Appeal’s broad interpretation of “material change” will “elevate the risk \nprofile for corporate Directors and Officers, thereby putting pressure on the availability, \nscope and cost of [Director and Officer] insurance in Canada” (I.F., at para.  5). \nAdopting this broad interpretation possibly opens the floodgates to litigation, running \ncounter to the desire to reduce unmeritorious litigation in the form of the leave \nrequirem ent contained within s.  138.8 of the Act, a desire that has also been \nunderscored by our Court ( Theratechnologies , at paras.  30 and 34). It also has the effect \nof increasing costs for directors and officers to defend themselves, which therefore \nplaces stra in on insurers to provide director and officer insurance. The Insurance \nBureau, at para.  22 of its factum, quotes from an article that offers a warning  — one \nthat remains salient  — regarding the impact of the expansion of directors’ and officers’ \nliability  on the supply of insurance:  \nThe statutory expansions of directors’ and officers’ liability could lead \nto a withdrawal of insurance supply if, in addition to expanding the need \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n \n for liability insurance, they increase the uncertainty surrounding the \nliabilit y standard and the application of that standard.  \n \n(Quoting R. J. Daniels and S. M. Hutton, “The Capricious Cushion: The \nImplications of the Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance Liability Crisis on \nCanadian Corporate Governance” (1993), 22 Can. Bus.

L.J.  182, at pp.  222 \nand 228.)  \n[255]  Second, the heightened risks of litigation against directors and officers \nimperils the prospective recruitment of qualified individuals to serve in those critical \npositions. Civil liability attaches to failure to adhere to the disclos ure regime (see \ns. 138.3 of the Act). By broadening the range of circumstances that may give rise to \npersonal liability, the interpretation adopted below, and by my colleague, risks what \nthe Insurance Bureau aptly describes as a “liability chill” (I.F., at  para.  19, quoting \nToronto Stock Exchange Committee on Corporate Governance in Canada, “Where \nWere The Directors?”: Guidelines For Improved Corporate Governance In Canada  \n(1994, Peter Dey, Q.C., Chair)). This chill could have significant consequences: it \nundermines the recruitment and service of skilled and talented directors and officers \nand, in doing so, runs counter to the Act’s stated purposes of fostering capital \nformation, ensuring fair and efficient capital markets, and contributing to financial \nsystem stability. These objectives depend on the availability of capable individuals \nwilling to serve as officers and directors without disproportionate exposure to legal \nrisk. A narrowing of the pool of leadership talent would frustrate, rather than further, \nthe purposes that the Act is intended to advance.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n \n [256]  While my colleague rightly points out that disclosure decisions are a matter \nof “legal obligation”, he fails to engage with the significant liability concerns that his \nbroad interpretation will engender for  issuers, directors, and officers, as well as its \nimpact on the availability and cost of directors’ and officers’ insurance (para.  97). \n(c) Conclusion on the Definition of “Material Change”  \n[257]  “Material change” has two components that must be kept distinct: wheth er \na change in the business, operations, or capital of the issuer has occurred and whether \nit is material. A change occurs when an issuer’s business, operations, or capital, \nunderstood at a high level of generality, is put in a different position, or on a different \ncourse, or in a different direction. It excludes external facts (unless they result in a \nchange in the business, operations, or capital of the issuer), fluctuations in revenue and \nproduction, uncertain developments, events that maintain the statu s quo, and routine or \nordinary occurrences, and instead the Act requires disclosure of developments that \nrepresent a change to the core aspects of the issuer’s business, operations, or capital, \ntaking into account all the circumstances of the case as part of the fact -specific inquiry. \nThe motion judge’s definition recognized these requirements. I see no error in his \nanalysis.  \n[258]  Moreover, I fail to see how the interpretation of the motion judge is either \n“restrictive” or prone to “ossif[y]” the statute or impo ses a “strict legal formula” that \nruns counter to “ordinary meaning” (Jamal  J.’s reasons, at paras.  6, 71 -72 and 96). It is \nneither rigid, nor strict, nor technical. His definitions are sufficiently expansive and \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n \n emerge from the ordinary usage of the words  and their placement beside one another. \nTo reiterate, those definitions are as follows: “change” is “a different position, course, \nor direction”; “business” is “what the company does”; “operations” are the activities \nconducted by the company to engage in its lines of “business”; and “capital”, is the \nissuer’s “share structure and rights of shareholders”. These definitions are sufficiently \nbroad and flexible. They provide guidance to issuers, investors, and courts and \ntribunals. They provide greater certain ty and predictability for issuers and investors \nalike.  \n[259]  As a final note on the definition of “material change”, I agree with my \ncolleague that it is unnecessary to import the standard articulated in some Ontario case \nlaw that requires that a “change” be “important” or “substantial”, but I disagree with \nhis assertion that the motion judge effectively did so (paras.  76 and 87).

In fact, the \nmotion judge made a point of saying the following, after examining that line of cases:  \nWhether or not the change is co nsidered to be “substantial” or “important”, \nthe key conclusion from both Green . . . and Mask is that a change occurs \nwhen the event results in a different position, course, or direction to a \ncompany’s business, operations, or capital. Otherwise, the dist inction \nbetween material change and material fact would be lost. [para.  151] \nIn my view, the motion judge does not adopt the higher standard from Green  or Mask \nbut rather adopts a definition of “change” that situates that word within qualitative \nparameters  and ties it to the general terms “business”, “operations” and “capital”. This \ninterpretation does not covertly raise the threshold for materiality beyond what is \nintended by the Act. By introducing the language of “different position, course, or \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n \n direction ” and by elucidating the meaning of “business, operations or capital”, the \nstandard does not impose stringent requirements but rather gives courts and the \nsecurities industry guidance on whether a particular event results in a change in \nbusiness, operation s, or capital that must be considered for materiality and potential \ndisclosure based on each unique factual matrix.  \n[260]  In line with this, I disagree with the assertion of the Court of Appeal (at \nparas.  82 and 84) and my colleague (at paras.  76-78) that the mo tion judge’s \ninterpretation collapses the assessment of a “change” with the assessment of \n“materiality”. Finding that changes to the issuer’s business, operations, or capital must \nbe understood at a high level of generality does nothing to diminish or coll apse the \nrequirement of materiality. Under the motion judge’s interpretation, two distinct \nanalyses must occur: first, the “change” must be to a high -level or core element of the \nissuer’s business, operations, or capital; then, if it is, it must be assesse d for materiality, \ni.e., to determine if it can “reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the \nmarket price or value of any of the securities of the issuer”. There is no collapse of the \nanalysis. There are two steps, both of which provide mean ingful screening mechanisms \nto ensure that issuers are not obliged to immediately disclose insignificant or routine \nevents.  \n[261]  As my colleague rightly notes (at para.  77), the materiality component must \nstill consider the magnitude of the change’s potential i mpact on the market price or \nvalue of the issuer’s securities, and materiality is “objectively determined from the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n \n perspective of a reasonable investor, and the applicable standard is defined in strictly \neconomic terms” (C.A. reasons, at para.  81, citing Kerr (C.A.), at para.  53, aff’d 2007 \nSCC 44, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331; Cornish , at paras.  55 and 65 -66; Rex Diamond  (Div. Ct.), \nat para.  6; Miller v. FSD Pharma, Inc. , 2020 ONSC 4054, at para.  64). None of these \nimportant legal requirements have been altered. And none indicate that the legislature \ndid not intend for “a change in the business, operations or capital” to speak to changes \nin the core or high -level aspects of an issuer. They only speak to the fact that the impact \nof the potential change on the marke t price or value of the securities is considered at \nthe second stage of the immediate disclosure analysis, after a “change” to the business, \noperations, or capital has been identified.  \nB.

He writes: “.  . . statutory \ninterpretation is not conducted less stringently on a motion for leave u nder s.  138.8(1). \nThe interpretation of the provisions at issue must still be correct” (para.  118). In other \nwords, a more lenient definition of “material change” does not apply at the leave stage \nwhile a more constrained version would apply when the matte r is heard on the merits. \nI agree.  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n \n [263]  To bring a claim against an issuer for failing to disclose a material change \nas is required, the plaintiff must apply for leave under s.  138.8(1) of the Act, which \nstates:  \n138.8  (1) No action may be commenced under sectio n 138.3 without leave \nof the court granted upon motion with notice to each defendant. The court \nshall grant leave only where it is satisfied that,  \n \n(a) the action is being brought in good faith; and  \n \n(b) there is a reasonable possibility that the action will be re solved \nat trial in favour of the plaintiff.  \n[264]  In Theratechnologies , our Court addressed the leave requirement found in \nQuebec’s securities legislation, which is similar to that of Ontario and other provinces. \nIn that case, Abella  J., writing for the Court, explained that the statutory civil liability \nregime was intended to reduce the burden on investors seeking to bring their claims, \nbut the addition of a leave requirement was intended to serve as a “robust screening \nmechanism” (para.  19) to ensure that “case s without merit are prevented from \nproceeding” and to prevent “strike suits and costly unmeritorious litigation” \n(paras.  38-39). The threshold is “more than a ‘speed bump’” (para.  38). However, the \nscreening mechanism is not intended to become a “mini -trial” (Dyck v. Tahoe \nResources Inc. , 2021 ONSC 5712, at para.  92). \n[265]  In the present case, only s.  138.8(1)(b)  — the requirement that there be “a \nreasonable possibility that the action will be resolved at trial in favour of the \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n \n plaintiff”  — is implicated. In Theratechnologies , our Court provided the following \ninterpretation of that provision, as requiring  \nthe claimant to offer both a plausible analysis of the applicable \nlegislative provisions , and some credible evidence in support of the claim . \nThis approach, in my view, best realizes the legislative intent of the \nscreening mechanism: to ensure that cases with little chance of \nsuccess  — and the time and expense they impose  — are avoided. \n[Emphasis added; para.  39.] \n[266]  This excerpt makes it clear that our Court set ou t a two -part test to \ndetermine what constitutes “a reasonable possibility that the action will be resolved at \ntrial in favour of the plaintiff”. My colleague finds that the plaintiff must “offer both a \nplausible analysis of the applicable legislative provi sions, and some credible evidence \nin support of the claim” (para.  106 (emphasis added)). I agree.  \n[267]  The appellants ask our Court to clarify whether the leave requirement in s. \n138.8 modifies or lessens the burden to establish a “material change”. This comes after \nthe Court of Appeal’s comment that material change should be defined broadly, \nespecially  in the context of a motion for leave (paras.  7 and 82).  \n[268]  In my view, the Court of Appeal erred in framing the test in this manner, \nwhich is inconsistent with Ther atechnologies .

[para.  67] \n[269]  The Court of Appeal’s language raises the question of whether plaintiffs \nneed only present a “plausible interpretation” of the term “material change” or whether \nthe statu te’s interpretation remains static at all stages of litigation. Of course, statutory \ninterpretation does not change based on the stage of proceedings. On this point, I agree \nwith my colleague (paras.  118-19). The language “plausible analysis” does not refe r to \nthe interpretation  of the statute, which must be correct and not merely plausible. \nInstead, the phrase “plausible analysis” requires that the application of the statute to \nthe available evidence be plausible. I also agree with the intervener Canadian Coalition \nfor Good Governance that a consistent definition of “material change” “will increase \ncertainty for both investors and issuers”, thereby fulfilling the “objectives of fairness, \ninvestor protection, integrity, and efficiency that lie at the heart o f Canadian securities \nlegislation” (I.F., at para.  4). \n[270]  While a different evidentiary standard is employed at this stage, the \ndefinition of “material change” should not and does not differ based on the stage of the \nproceeding. Therefore, the motion judge wa s correct to apply his own interpretation of \nthe term “material change” rather than leaving the interpretation open for the parties to \nsettle at trial.  \nC. Application  \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n \n [271]  Having adopted the interpretation of “material change” advanced by the \nmotion judge, I proceed on the basis that the Court of Appeal’s role was to review his \napplication of the operative legal standard for palpable and overriding error, as it was \na question of mixed fact and law ( Housen v. Nikolaisen , 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. \n235, at par a. 36). \n[272]  I find that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that Mr.  Markowich \ncould satisfy the leave requirement set out in s.  138.8 of the Act. To succeed, \nMr. Markowich had to satisfy the court that he had a reasonable possibility of \nsuccessfully estab lishing at trial that the pit wall instability or rock slide constituted a \nchange in Lundin Mining’s business, operations, or capital. I find that he would not be \nable to do that with the proper interpretation of “material change”, and therefore the \nmotion  judge was correct to deny him leave.  \n[273]  None of the four exclusions that circumscribe the meaning of change that \nI outlined earlier apply in this case. I must therefore consider the facts specific to this \ncase, mindful that the Court of Appeal’s role was to review the motion judge’s finding \non a standard of palpable of overriding error.  \n[274]  The motion judge made a number of factual findings, to which the Court \nof Appeal owed deference. These include his description of the Candelaria mine plan \nas being completed i n several phases, with Phases 9 through 13 left to be mined when \nthe pit wall instability was found and the rock slide occurred. At that time, Lundin \nMining was mining Phase  9 and parts of Phase 10 (motion judge reasons, at para.  48). \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n \n The motion judge also  found as a fact that both the pit wall instability and rock slide \nwere “localized”, resulting in the evacuation of Lundin Mining personnel from the \nimmediate area.

    "text": ". At that time, Lundin \nMining was mining Phase  9 and parts of Phase 10 (motion judge reasons, at para.  48). \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n \n The motion judge also  found as a fact that both the pit wall instability and rock slide \nwere “localized”, resulting in the evacuation of Lundin Mining personnel from the \nimmediate area. He noted that there was no evidence concerning whether any other \nparts of the mine were shu t down as a result (paras.  59 and 62 -63). \n[275]  More substantively, the motion judge considered whether the facts of \nLundin Mining’s resequencing in response to the events were anything but routine or \nwere out of the ordinary. He found that as a result of the ev ents, Lundin Mining deferred \nless than 5 percent of its annual production and engaged in some resequencing in \naddition to the resequencing it had already planned. He found that these adjustments \ndid not constitute “a change in the business, operations or c apital of the issuer”:  \nThe only effect was that 15,200 tonnes of copper mining was deferred until \n2020 or 2021, with some increased costs and decreased revenues arising \nfrom milling lower quality copper. The deferred copper represented less \nthan 5% of Lund in [Mining]’s annual production, which was already \nscheduled to be reduced  (by a lower amount) due to previously planned \nresequencing.  \n \n. . . \n \n. . . Changes to [a life of mine plan] to address resequencing are part of \nthe ordinary business  and operation of  a copper mining company. Such \nresequencing was already planned before the Pit Wall Instability and the \nRock Slide. Some additional resequencing which is done to address the \nordinary occurrence of pit wall instability and a rock slide does not \ntransform re sequencing into a material change . \n \n. . . \n \nUnlike Rex Diamond  or Cornish , there is no evidence that either the Pit \nWall Instability or the Rock Slide had any effect on Lundin [Mining]’s \n“line of business”. Lundin [Mining] continued to engage in copper mining \nby making some additional changes to its resequencing plan.  Lundin \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n \n [Mining] did not lose the ability to conduct its business. [Underlining \nadded; paras.  173, 185 and 187.]  \n[276]  Further, he considered and found that there are inherent risks to the industr y \nin which Lundin Mining conducted its business, a factor which, as I outlined above, is \nappropriate to consider:  \nThe evidence is that the Pit Wall Instability and the Rock Slide were \ninherent risks in open pit mining operation, and that Lundin [Mining]  \nmanaged those risks with advanced ground radar technology and operated \nits business under those risks. When such a risk occurred, it may have been \na material fact which would reasonably be expected to have a significant \neffect on Lundin [Mining] ’s shares, bu t there is no evidence to support that \neither of the events was a material change to Lundin [Mining] ’s business, \noperations, or capital. It did not constitute a different position, course, or \ndirection. [Emphasis in original; footnote omitted; para.  179.]  \n[277]  Even so, he appropriately found that “routine disclosure” of the inherent \nrisks of mining to shareholders did not “inoculate” Lundin Mining from disclosing a \nparticular event if the impact of that event constituted a “material change” (motion \njudge reasons , at para.  186).  \n[278]  Taking this all into account, the motion judge found that the pit wall \ninstability and the rock slide themselves were not changes in Lundin Mining’s business, \noperations, or capital.  \n[279]  Unlike the Court of Appeal, I can see no error in his an alysis. The events \nmerely necessitated modestly adjusting already planned “resequencing”. Pit wall \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 143 ---\n \n instability and rock slides are fairly routine occurrences in open pit mining. This is why \nthese risks were previously disclosed and risk mitigation was put in place. The fact that \nthe risks predicted materialized, in this particular case, on these particular facts, did not \nresult in changes in the business, operations, or capital of Lundin Mining.  \n[280]  Therefore, unlike the Court of Appeal, I would uphold the moti on judge’s \ndecision and deny Mr.",

Conclusion  \n[281]  In sum, the interpretation of “material change” advanced by the motion \njudge properly reflects the text, context, and purpose of the Act. It preserves the  \nlegislature’s careful distinction between “material facts”, which are disclosed \nperiodically, and “material changes”, which require immediate disclosure. By \nconstruing a “change” as a shift in the issuer’s core aspects  — its business, operations, \nor capit al — one that puts the issuer in a different position, or on a different course, or \ndirection, the motion judge articulated definitions that are faithful to the statutory \nlanguage and the Act’s underlying policy objectives. This approach ensures that routi ne \ninternal developments do not trigger unnecessary disclosure obligations, while events \nthat genuinely merit providing prompt notice to the market are still captured.  \n[282]  I agree with Lundin Mining that the standard as laid out by the Court of \nAppeal  — and no w adopted by my colleague  — effectively conflates the question of \nwhether a change has taken place with the question of its materiality, and, in doing so, \n2025 SCC 39 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n \n elides the distinction between a material fact and a material change. This interpretation \nblurs the A ct’s core distinction, disregards the legislature’s careful balancing, and \nimposes a disclosure standard broader than what is statutorily required.  \n[283]  This approach may have far -reaching impacts that strike at the heart of the \nAct’s objectives to promote not only fair but also efficient and competitive markets and \nto foster capital formation. A disclosure standard that imposes excessive strain on \nissuers and muddies the informational landscape for investors ultimately undermines \nmarket integrity rather than st rengthening it.  \n[284]  For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the \nCourt of Appeal, and restore the motion judge’s order dismissing the motion for leave \nto bring the action. In so doing, I endorse the interpretation of “material change” \nadopted by the motion judge, as I have outlined in these reasons.  \nAPPENDIX  \nRelevant Statutory Provisions  \n \nOntario Securities Act , R.S.O. 1990, c.
