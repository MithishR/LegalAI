A few minut es after G’s arrest, four text messages from a \nsender, D, lit up the lock screen of the phone, appearing to offer to sell drugs to G. Over \nthe next 2 hours and 15 minutes, the police, without a warrant, replied to the texts by \nimpersonating G and encourage d the sender to come to G’s residence to deliver the \ndrugs. When the accused came to G’s residence that evening, he was arrested and found \nin possession of heroin laced with fentanyl and was charged with drug trafficking and \npossession offences.  The accuse d claimed that he did not send the first four texts and \nthat D had given him the phone to arrange the delivery of the drugs to G.

The trial judge \nfound that because the accused did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the \ntexts, he lacked standing to argue that his s.  8 Charter  rights had been infringed. The \ntrial judge added that ev en had he concluded that the accused had standing, the \nwarrantless search would have been justified by exigent circumstances under s.  11(7) \nof the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act  (“CDSA ”). He also rejected the accused’s \nargument that the police had con ducted an unlawful interception of his electronic \ncommunications contrary to Part VI of the Criminal Code . In the further alternative, he \nwould not have excluded the texts from evidence under s.  24(2) of the Charter . The \naccused was subsequently convicted of the charges against him and appealed his \nconvictions.  The Court of Appeal accepted that the accused had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in his text message conversation and thus had standing to argue \nthat the police violated his rights under s.  8. However, it concluded that the search was \njustified by exigent circumstances under s.  11(7) of the CDSA . Accordingly, it \ndismissed the appeal.  \n Held (Karakatsanis , Martin and Moreau  JJ. dissenting): The appeal should \nbe dismissed.  \n Per Wagner  C.J. and Kasir er, Jamal  and O’Bonsawin  JJ.: The accused had  \na reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message conversation with the user of \nG’s phone and had standing to challenge the search under s.  8 of the Charter . The \nwarrantless search of the accused’s text message conversation was justified by “exigent \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n circumstances” that made it “impracticable” to obtain a warrant under s.  11(7) of the \nCDSA . The search was thus reasonable and justified by law and did not breach s . 8. \n The main purpose of s.  8 of the Charter , which guarantees that everyone \nhas the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, is to protect the right \nto privacy from unjustified state intrusion . A claimant seeking standing to argue that \ntheir rights under s.  8 were infringed must show that they subjectively expected the \nsubject matter of the search would remain private, and that their expectation was \nobjectively reasonable having regard to the totality of the circumstances. In making this  \nevaluation, courts are guided by four lines of inquiry: (1)  the subject matter of the \nalleged search; (2)  whether the claimant had a direct interest in the subject matter; \n(3) whether the claimant had a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject mat ter; \nand (4)  whether the claimant’s subjective expectation of privacy was objectively \nreasonable.  \n First, when the state examines text messages, the subject matter of the \nalleged search is properly characterized as the electronic conversation between two o r \nmore people. The subject matter of the search includes the existence of the \nconversation, the identities of the participants, the information shared, and any \ninferences about associations and activities that can be drawn from that information. \nSecond, a claimant would have a direct interest in a text message conversation if they \nparticipated in the conversation and wrote several of the texts at issue. Third, a \nclaimant’s burden of establishing a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n matter of t he alleged search is not a high hurdle. It can be presumed or inferred in the \ncircumstances in the absence of the claimant’s testimony or admission at the voir dire . \nFourth, in determining whether a subjective expectation of privacy is objectively \nreasonab le, courts must employ an approach that is both normative and content -neutral.  \n There is no closed or definitive list of factors relevant to whether a \nclaimant’s subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter of a search is \nobjectively reasonable.

    "text": " claimant’s testimony or admission at the voir dire . \nFourth, in determining whether a subjective expectation of privacy is objectively \nreasonab le, courts must employ an approach that is both normative and content -neutral.  \n There is no closed or definitive list of factors relevant to whether a \nclaimant’s subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter of a search is \nobjectively reasonable.  However, the private nature of the subject matter is a critical \nfactor in establishing a reasonable expectation of privacy. Courts must focus on \nwhether the subject matter of the search at issue has the potential or tendency to reveal \nprivate information about the claimant.  With respect to text messages in particular, the \nfocus is not on the actual contents of the messages the police have seized, but rather on \nthe potential of a given electronic conversation to reveal personal or biographical \ninformation, such as intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the \nindividual.  In addition, the intrusiveness of the police technique in relation to the \nprivacy interest at issue can be another important factor in assessing whether a \nclaimant’s subjecti ve expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable. This is a distinct \nconsideration from whether the police acted lawfully at the second stage of the s.  8 \ninquiry.  \n In contrast, the level of control a claimant has over information is not \ndeterminative of  the question of standing. Control is not an absolute indicator of a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, nor is lack of control fatal to a privacy interest. A \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n person does not lose control of information for the purposes of s.  8 simply because \nanother person  possesses it or can access it. As a result, text message conversations \nmay be protected by a zone of privacy that extends beyond a person’s own mobile \ndevice to the recipient of the message, even when the person shares private information \nwith others. The  zone of privacy protected by s.  8 of the Charter  involves the right to \nkeep personal information safe from state intrusion.  \n Once a claimant has established standing to argue that their rights under \ns. 8 were infringed, the next step is to determine wheth er the police acted lawfully, \nwhich is relevant to whether the state conduct was unreasonable. A search is reasonable \nunder s.  8 if it is authorized by a reasonable law and conducted in a reasonable manner. \nHowever, a warrantless search is presumptively un reasonable, shifting the burden of \npersuasion to the Crown to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the search was \nreasonable.  \n Parliament enacted Part VI of the Criminal Code  as a comprehensive \nregime to address the interception of private commun ications by balancing the \nindividual right to privacy with the collective need for law enforcement. Under Part VI, \ns. 184(1)(a) creates an indictable offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment \nif a person knowingly intercepts a private communicati on by use of any \nelectro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, or other device. For there to be an interception \nunder Part VI, the police must use a device employing intrusive surveillance \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n technology.  Unless the police use intrusive surveillance technology, poli ce deception \nor trickery does not amount to an interception under Part VI.  \n The police have authority at common law to search a person incident to a \nlawful arrest and to seize anything in their possession or in the surrounding area of the \narrest. This powe r is extraordinary because it does not require a warrant or reasonable \nand probable grounds. It simply requires some reasonable basis for what the police did. \nA search incident to arrest is lawful if: (1)  the arrest itself was lawful; (2)  the search \nwas tr uly incidental to the arrest, in that it was for a valid law enforcement objective \nconnected to the arrest; and (3)  the search was conducted reasonably. Valid law \nenforcement objectives include ensuring the safety of the police or the public, \npreventing th e destruction of evidence, and uncovering evidence that could be used at \ntrial. \n Section 11(1) of the CDSA  authorizes a justice to issue a warrant to search \na place for a controlled substance and to seize it. By exception, s.  11(7) authorizes a \npeace offic er to search the place without a warrant, if the conditions for a warrant exist \nbut exigent circumstances make it impracticable to obtain one. Section 11(7) thus has \ntwo requirements. First, it must be shown that there were exigent circumstances, which \ndenote not merely",

By exception, s.  11(7) authorizes a \npeace offic er to search the place without a warrant, if the conditions for a warrant exist \nbut exigent circumstances make it impracticable to obtain one. Section 11(7) thus has \ntwo requirements. First, it must be shown that there were exigent circumstances, which \ndenote not merely convenience, propitiousness, or economy, but rather urgency, arising \nfrom circumstances calling for immediate police action to preserve evidence, officer \nsafety, or public safety. Second, it must be shown that the conditions for obtaining a \nwarrant existed, but that exigent circumstances rendered it impracticable to obtain a \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n warrant, meaning that it was impossible in practice or unmanageable to obtain a \nwarrant. Regarding the evidentiary threshold, the police must have reasonable and \nprobable  grounds, rather than merely reasonable suspicion, for the claimed exigency \nunder s.  11(7). The Crown must establish the reasonable probability of the claimed \nexigency, based on the experience and expertise of the police and the relevant facts \nbefore them.  As for the standard of appellate review, a trial judge’s assessment of the \nevidence and findings of fact in applying s.  11(7) attract substantial deference on \nappeal; however, whether the facts as found by the trial judge meet the legal standard \nfor exige ncy under s.  11(7) is a question of law reviewable for correctness.  \n In the instant case, the four lines of inquiry under s.  8 establish the \naccused’s reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message conversation with who \nhe thought was G. Specificall y, in regard to the only disputed point, it has been \nestablished that the accused’s subjective expectation of privacy was objectively \nreasonable. First, concerning the private nature of the subject matter, the alleged search \nof the accused’s text message c onversation intruded into a medium of communication \nin which a reasonable person would ordinarily expect the utmost privacy. Second, the \npolice used an especially intrusive investigative technique by  inserting themselves into \na conversation that was alread y underway, between two real people with a pre -existing \nrelationship, essentially hijacking the identity of one of the participants. Third, \nregarding the level of control over the information, the accused  did not lose the \nprotection of s.  8 of the Charter  simply by sharing private information with the other \nparty to his text message conversation or by using the phone of an acquaintance.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n \n  With respect to the reasonableness of the search, the police’s investigative \ntechnique of engaging in a text message conv ersation with the accused from G’s phone \nwas not an interception under Part VI of the Criminal Code since the police did not use \na device employing an intrusive surveillance technology. They simply responded to \ntext messages received on G’s phone, the same  medium of communication or device \nthe accused had used to make the communication. However, t he search of G’s \ncellphone was not incident to a lawful arrest as it was not a search strictly related to \nG’s arrest or the offence for which he was arrested. Inst ead, it was a search to collect \nevidence against D, who turned out to be the accused. Nonetheless, the  police had \nauthority for a warrantless search under s.  11(7) of the CDSA  due to exigent \ncircumstances. The police reasonably believed that they faced an urgent situation \ninvolving a suspected drug sale calling for immediate police action to prevent the drugs \nfrom being trafficked in the community imminently. The police also had reasonable \nand probable grounds to believe the transaction specifically involve d heroin laced with \nfentanyl, which posed a grave risk to public safety. Although the police had grounds to \nobtain a warrant, it was impracticable to obtain one as only a telewarrant would have \nbeen available at that time of day and it would likely arrive too late to complete this \ntransaction. Since the police did not infringe s.  8 of the Charter , it is not necessary to \naddress whether the evidence should have been excluded under s.  24(2) of the Charter . \n Per Rowe  J.: There is full agreement with Jamal  J. in his reasons and in \nthe result.

Proper effect must be given to the governi ng \nprecedent on exigent circumstances under s.  11(7) of the CDSA , R. v. Paterson , 2017 \nSCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202. Paterson  sets out a definitive statement of the doctrine \nof exigent circumstances, which statement continues to govern. While earlier case l aw \ncan provide a degree of insight into exigent circumstances, it is not a basis to sidestep \nthe law as stated in Paterson . Such an approach would undermine precedent and invite \nsophistry in legal argument.  \n Under Paterson , one way urgency can arise is whe n immediate police \naction is needed to preserve public safety. The facts in this case come within exigent \ncircumstances as described in Paterson . The harm to the public was imminent as there \nwas a narrow window of opportunity  for police to prevent what the y reasonably \nbelieved was the sale by D of a significant quantity of drugs containing fentanyl. If the \npolice failed, they believed it could well lead to deaths in the community. This was a \nnow-or-never situation. The Crown did not have to establish that D  had another \ntransaction lined up if the transaction with G fell through. This would implicitly elevate \nthe evidentiary requirements for exigent circumstances beyond reasonable and \nprobable grounds.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n  With respect to the s.  24(2) Charter analysis, the evidence demonstrates \nthat the police actively turned their mind to the question of judicial authorization before \nconcluding that they had no time to obtain a warrant. While the communications \nbetween the police and the accused ultimately extended over two  hours, the police had \nno way to know this. In a volatile and uncertain situation, minutes could well have \nmade the difference between intercepting the fentanyl or having the opportunity to do \nso slip through their fingers.  \n Per Côté  J.: The police conduct  did not amount to a search for the purposes \nof s. 8 of the Charter . Applying the totality of the circumstances test and having regard \nfor the normative approach that informs s.  8 Charter  jurisprudence and for the factual \nrecord in this case, the accused’s  subjective expectation of privacy in the electronic \ncommunications between him and G was not objectively reasonable . \n The determination of whether the police have conducted a search for the \npurposes of s.  8 directly hinges on the presence of a claimant’s reasonable expectation \nof privacy within the specific circumstances of the case. Courts must balance \nsometimes conflicting interests in the privacy necessary for personal dignity and \nautonomy and the need for a secure and safe society. Not every government  \nexamination or investigatory technique will constitute a search under the Charter . It is \nonly if the police activity invades a reasonable expectation of privacy that the activity \nis a search. For claimants to benefit from s.  8 protection against unreasona ble state \nconduct, they must have a subjective expectation of privacy in the putative search, and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n their subjective expectation must be objectively reasonable. Courts must make this \nassessment having regard to the totality of the circumstances of a given ca se. The \nCourt’s decision in R. v. Marakah , 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, did not create a \ncategorical rule that all text message conversations or other electronic communications \ninherently attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.

    "text": ". Marakah , 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, did not create a \ncategorical rule that all text message conversations or other electronic communications \ninherently attract a reasonable expectation of privacy. The totality of th e circumstances \ntest mandates an individualized and case -by-case analysis, requiring a court to treat an \nassessment under s.  8 as a contextual, fact -based inquiry. While the normative approach \nto privacy is important to help ascertain the free and democrat ic society that reasonable \nand informed Canadians expect to live in, courts cannot lose sight of the totality of the \ncircumstances of the specific cases before them and, accordingly, the police conduct \ntherein.  \n The police cannot peruse the contents of a p hone at liberty and without any \nlimits; however, their actions may be appropriate if they limit and circumscribe the \nscope of their conduct to the investigation before them. In the instant case,  the police \nwere at liberty to view and respond to the four te xt messages from D that they passively \nreceived and observed on G’s lawfully seized phone. Indeed, the police were \nconducting an undercover investigation into criminal activity directly associated with \nthe purpose underlying G’s arrest — a drug transaction . On a holistic view of the \nmatter, it is clear that from the time they observed those four messages, the officers \nreasonably suspected that they were dealing with a drug transaction that was \nsufficiently connected to the arrest of G that had just been mad e. There was no \npre-existing conversation between the accused and G that the police searched. Instead, \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n the police participated in the electronic exchange as part of an undercover drug \ninvestigation. Where the police execute a search warrant and the target’ s phone rings, \nthere is nothing wrong with the police answering that phone. The fact that text messages \ncreate a permanent record does not transform the analogous conduct in this case into a \nsearch or seizure.  \n Beyond the undercover nature of the investig ation, there are multiple \nfactors that support the conclusion that the accused’s subjective expectation of privacy \nwas not objectively reasonable. The first factor is the circumscribed nature and lack of \nintrusiveness of the police conduct. The way the pol ice carried out the conversation \nwith the accused, making sure not to ask any probing questions or deviate from \nfacilitating the drug deal, ensured that no biographical core information was obtained \nthrough the conversation aside from what was already lawf ully known to police from \nthe first four messages. The police also did not intrusively search the contents of G’s \nphone, nor did they unlock it.  The police were only focused on facilitating and \ncompleting the drug transaction.  \n The second factor is  the ow nership of and control over the device and the \nelectronic communications therein, which are relevant but not determinative concepts \nin the context of s.  8 protection. The accused’s  lack of total control over the \nconversation and ownership of the phone support a significantly diminished \nexpectation of privacy, which is not objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this \ncase. The accused had, at best, a shared control with D over  the phone. The place where \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n the conversation occurs remains as one of several factors that must be weighed. The \nevidence is to the effect that the phone was D’s and was given to the accused to \nfacilitate the drug transaction. The accused’s lack of ownershi p over both the phone \nand the first four messages is closely related to his lack of control over them.  The four \ntext messages did not come from the accused but were sent by D to G. The borrowed \nphone was also to be returned to D following the completed del ivery.  \n The third factor is the distinction between the circumstances of the present \ncase and those existing in Marakah . The more people that are involved in a \nconversation and the less control one has over who might see it, the more likely it is \nthat one ’s subjective expectation of privacy will not be objectively reasonable. In \nMarakah , that accused’s reasonable expectation of privacy was diminished due to his \nlack of control in a two -party electronic conversation on cell phones that were owned \nby the par ties to the conversation. The fact that there was even less control in the present \ncase suggests that the accused’s expectation of privacy was significantly diminished \nand, indeed, entirely negated when the totality of the circumstances are considered. \nFurthermore, the accused barely knew G.

Unlike the accused in Marakah , the accused \nhere never asked G to keep their electronic communications private; nor did he ask him \nto delete any of the messages.  \n The electronic communications therefore did not reveal a ny information \nthat implicated the biographical core of the accused, nor were they likely, based on the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n \n normative nature of the s.  8 inquiry, to reveal any, given the circumscribed nature of \nthe police investigation.  \n There is disagreement with aspects of the dissent’s analysis. In particular, \nthe consequences of the implied conclusion that the investigation in this case amounted \nto an interception are significant. This would require a Part VI Criminal Code  \nauthorization rather than a general warrant, thus imposing greater requirements for \nobtaining authorization, and creating significant hurdles for law enforcement \ninvestigations. With respect to exigent circumstances, the Court should avoid \nspeculating about what other potential investigative techniques wo uld have succeeded \nin the absence of a proper evidentiary foundation, such as applying for a production \norder. It is also unclear whether a production order would be enough to locate whoever \nwas using D’s phone. Finally, the perceived intrusiveness of the police technique \nshould not colour the Court’s analysis of the facts in the s.  24(2) Charter analysis. The \nlaw in Ontario at the time was that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in a \nco-accused’s cell phone. There was consequently no reason at all for police to think \nthat interjecting themselves into the conversation was a problem. The police also \nalready lawfully knew from the first four messages that whoever responded was \ninvolved in criminal activity, which should lessen the impact on the acc used’s privacy \ninterests. Where the circumstances of the police investigation significantly increase the \nreasonableness of the police conduct at the time, this should be considered in the \nanalysis of whether the administration of justice would be brought i nto disrepute by the \nadmission of the evidence.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n  Per Karakatsanis , Martin  and Moreau  JJ. (dissenting):  The appeal should \nbe allowed, the convictions set aside, and acquittals entered. The warrantless police \nactions engaged and breached the accused’s s.  8 Charter  right to be free from \nunreasonable search and seizure. The police actions cannot be justified by the power to \nsearch incident to arrest or exigent circumstances, and the admission of the evidence \nobtained would bring the administration of justice in to disrepute according to the \nfactors considered under s.  24(2) of the Charter .  \n The accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his electronic \ncommunications and his s.  8 Charter right was engaged. The totality of the \ncircumstances remains the cor rect approach to assessing whether a claimant has a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, including in cases where there is an undercover \naspect to the police conduct. Even if there are features of the investigative technique \nthat do not breach the individual ’s privacy rights, the focus must remain on the potential \nof a given technique to reveal private information in the totality of the circumstances. \nGiven the nature of the police conduct at issue, the breach of this privacy interest should \nbe understood as involving a high degree of intrusion. The technique of hijacking an \nexisting identity is predicated on exploiting an existing relationship between private \nactors, which has the potential to reveal to police deeply personal information. In \ncontrast to a pho ne conversation, where the police’s ability to impersonate a person \nknown to the caller is limited, within a text conversation, the potential for police to \nimpersonate the recipient and deceive the sender is limited only by their opportunities \nto do so and  the strictures of the law.

    "text": " the strictures of the law. It would gravely impact one’s trust in general, \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n and one’s trust in the state, if the last text received from an acquaintance or family \nmember was, instead, from the police in disguise . Recognizing that in a free and \ndemocratic s ociety the privacy claim in personal text message conversations between \nindividuals known to one another must be beyond state intrusion absent constitutional \njustification does not thwart the ability of police to investigate crimes and uncover \nevidence thr ough searches. It simply requires police to have lawful authority to do so.  \n Parliament has set out various ways in which prior judicial authorization \nmay be sought for state action which threatens a person’s reasonable expectation of \nprivacy. Here the po lice did not seek or obtain any such authorization and their \nwarrantless search was therefore a prima facie breach of s.  8, unless they could \nestablish the existence of special circumstances recognized in law as justifying their \nactions, and that both the authorizing law and manner in which the search was \nconducted was reasonable . Courts have defined these situations with care and \nspecificity. In the instant case, the search was not reasonable.  \n First, the warrantless investigative technique was not a searc h incident to \narrest because the police did not conduct it for a valid law enforcement purpose \nconnected to the reasons for the arrest. The power to search incident to arrest does not \nauthorize police to use a lawfully seized cell phone to communicate with  another \nperson. G’s arrest was not tied to the impending drug transaction with the accused. This \ntransaction constituted a probe into a distinct potential offence committed by another \nperson, which cannot be truly incidental to the reasons for G’s arrest.   \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n  Second, the warrantless search by the police was also not justified by the \nexigent circumstances doctrine, when properly understood in light of its limited \npurpose and cautious jurisprudential evolution. This doctrine cannot be understood \nseparate from the longstanding normative approach of the law of search and seizure \nthat, whenever feasible, intrusions upon property, privacy and dignity, should be \nauthorized in advance. From the Court’s jurisprudence in the years after the Charter \nwas first enacted, it is clear that exigent circumstances is a determination to be made \nwith care and that the Court has consistently taken a narrow approach to this doctrine.  \nA serious crime is not enough to establish exigency under a s.  8 analysis. Rather, it \nmust be deter mined according to the parameters of the law. Where individual privacy \ninterests are higher, such as in a home, the Court has delineated specific situations \nwhere exigency could justify intrusion in a given case, declining to recognize a general \ncommon law  power. Privacy interests in electronic devices should be approached with \nsimilar care.  \n Since Parliament codified certain warrantless powers to search in exigent \ncircumstances, and despite the absence of a statutory definition for such circumstances \nin s. 11(7) of the CDSA  and s. 487.11 of the Criminal Code , the requirements for \nestablishing exigent circumstances may be distilled into three elements: the existence \nof grounds for obtaining a warrant; the existence of exigent circumstances; and whether \nthose exigent circumstances rendered it impracticable for the police to obtain a warrant. \nThe jurisprudence recognizes the main categories of exigency as loss or destruction of \nevidence, officer or public safety, and hot pursuit. While the safety branch is \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n non-controversial as the societal interest in protection of human life is strong, it has \nonly been applied to override the requirement for prior authorization where the threat \nto safety is imminent, clear, and concrete. The jurisprudence supports a narrow and  \nstrict application of the safety branch. A generalized, societal safety concern cannot be \nsufficient to justify warrantless action unless it poses an imminent threat.  \n The f acts of this case do not establish an imminent  safety risk justifying \nwarrantless  police action and there were therefore no  exigent circumstances that \njustified the warrantless search. Regardless of whether or not the investigative \ntechnique in the instant case could have been authorized by s.  11(7) of the CDSA , which \ninvolves a lower standard of exigency than required under more rigorous authorities \npermitting warrantless acquisition of  real-time communications , the circumstances of \nthis case extend well beyond the recognized safety branch of the doctrine of exigent \ncircumstances.

    "text": " the warrantless search. Regardless of whether or not the investigative \ntechnique in the instant case could have been authorized by s.  11(7) of the CDSA , which \ninvolves a lower standard of exigency than required under more rigorous authorities \npermitting warrantless acquisition of  real-time communications , the circumstances of \nthis case extend well beyond the recognized safety branch of the doctrine of exigent \ncircumstances. Even  accepting that the quantity and type of drugs involved posed a risk \nof potential harm to public safety, the circumstances fall well short of the requirement \nof an imminent  risk to an individual or group.  The jurisprudence does not support a \nconclusion tha t the potential sale and subsequent use of a harmful drug constitutes \nexigency in the absence of a risk of imminent danger to police or public safety. To \ndefine these as exigent circumstances is to invite such a characterization whenever a \npotential drug t ransaction involves a dangerous substance regardless of the absence of \nimminent harm. This wrongly elevates the appropriate and ever -present concern over \npublic safety into exigent circumstances because of the health risks associated with the \nuse of unregu lated illicit drugs. The result will be to authorize invasive and extensive \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n \n police conduct outside of those rare instances in which the harm to public safety is so \nimminent and immediate, a prima facie  unreasonable warrantless search is judged to \nbe reason able. This approach waters  down the statutory regimes Parliament has enacted \nto regulate and restrict warrantless searches, and the protection of s.  8, which is both \nembodied in those regimes and exists independently of them. It is not the \nimpracticability  of obtaining the warrant that supports a finding of exigent \ncircumstances. That it would be difficult or inconvenient to obtain a warrant is not \nsufficient to meet this legal standard. Rather, the exigency must be shown to cause \nimpracticability. Since th ere were no exigent circumstances here, it follows that the \npracticable option was for the police to obtain a warrant to search G’s phone or pursue \nother investigative steps.  \n Under s.  24(2) of the Charter , whether the admission of evidence obtained \nin bre ach of the Charter  would bring the administration of justice into disrepute \nengages three avenues of inquiry: (1)  the seriousness of the Charter -infringing state \nconduct; (2)  the impact of the breach on the accused’s Charter -protected interests; and \n(3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. The first factor favours \nexclusion of the evidence: the absence of exigency or impracticability, combined with \na legally questionable police technique, and the additional breach of the accused ’s s. 8 \nrights following arrest cumulatively militate against admission of the evidence . The \nsecond factor also favours exclusion. The accused had a substantial Charter -protected \nprivacy interest in the conversation he had with G, which revealed private in formation \nthat went to the accused’s biographical core . The impact of the breach on this interest \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n was aggravated by the intrusive nature of the investigative technique. The strong causal \nconnection between the Charter  breach and the evidence obtained ampli fies the impact \non the accused. The third factor favours admission of the evidence. While the \nseriousness of the offence of fentanyl trafficking is not determinative of the analysis at \nthe third stage, here, the evidence obtained is reliable evidence of a serious crime and \nits exclusion would effectively gut the prosecution against the accused. In such \ncircumstances, society has a strong interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. \nWhere both the first and second factors strongly favour exclusion  of the evidence, the \nthird factor will seldom if ever tip the balance in favour of admissibility. On balance, \nthe administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by the admission of the \nevidence.  \nCases Cited  \nBy Jamal  J. \n Applied: R. v.

Introduction  \n[1] At issue in this appeal is whether the police had lawful authority to use the \ncellphone of an arrested drug dealer without a warrant to continue a text message \nconversation with another drug dealer. The police did so to stop what they reasonably \nbelieved w as the deadly cocktail of heroin laced with fentanyl from being trafficked \nimminently in the community.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n [2] To resolve this issue, the following elements must be addressed: (1) when \na person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their text message conver sation; (2) \nwhether the search of such a conversation by the police is an “interception” under Part \nVI of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C -46; (3) the scope of the police power to \nconduct a warrantless search of a text message conversation incident to a lawful arrest; \nand (4) when the warrantless search of a text message conversation may be justified by \n“exigent circumstances” under s. 11(7) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , \nS.C. 1996, c. 19 (“ CDSA ”). \n[3] Police lawfully seized a cellphone during a search incident to the arrest of \nKyle Gammie, a known drug dealer. Minutes after Mr. Gammie’s arrest, four text \nmessages from a sender named “Dew” lit up the lock screen of the phone, appearing to \noffer to sell drugs to Mr. Gammie. Based on several facto rs, including the proposed \nweight and price, the police believed that the texts likely revealed an in -progress drug \ntransaction for the sale of heroin laced with fentanyl. The police feared that the drugs \nwould be sold elsewhere in the community soon if th ey did not intervene, and so they \nbegan replying to the texts by impersonating Mr. Gammie and encouraging the sender \nto come to Mr. Gammie’s residence to deliver the drugs.  \n[4] The appellant, Dwayne Alexander Campbell, claimed that he did not send \nthe first",

    "text": " an in -progress drug \ntransaction for the sale of heroin laced with fentanyl. The police feared that the drugs \nwould be sold elsewhere in the community soon if th ey did not intervene, and so they \nbegan replying to the texts by impersonating Mr. Gammie and encouraging the sender \nto come to Mr. Gammie’s residence to deliver the drugs.  \n[4] The appellant, Dwayne Alexander Campbell, claimed that he did not send \nthe first fo ur texts and that another drug dealer named Dew had given him the phone to \ndeliver the drugs. Even so, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that he continued the text \nmessage conversation, which he expected would remain private. When Mr. Campbell \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n came to Mr. Gammie’s  residence later that day, he was arrested and found in possession \nof 14.33 grams of heroin laced with fentanyl. He was charged with trafficking and \npossession offences under the CDSA . \n[5] The trial judge rejected Mr. Campbell’s application to exclude the text s \nfrom evidence on the basis that the police investigative technique of engaging in a text \nmessage conversation with him from Mr. Gammie’s phone was a “search” that \ninfringed his right to be free from unreasonable search or seizure under s. 8 of the \nCanadi an Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The trial judge found that because Mr. \nCampbell did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the texts, the police did \nnot conduct a “search” under s. 8 and hence Mr. Campbell lacked standing to argue \nthat his s. 8  rights had been infringed. The trial judge added that even had he concluded \nthat Mr. Campbell had standing, the warrantless search would have been justified by \nexigent circumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . He also rejected Mr. Campbell’s \nargument that  the police had conducted an unlawful “interception” of his electronic \ncommunications contrary to Part VI (“Invasion of Privacy”) of the Criminal Code . In \nthe further alternative, the trial judge would not have excluded the evidence under s. \n24(2) of the Charter . As a result, the trial judge convicted Mr. Campbell of trafficking \nand possession offences under the CDSA  and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.  \n[6] The Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted that Mr. Campbell had a \nreasonable expectation of privac y in his text message conversation, but concluded that \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n the search was justified by exigent circumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . \nAccordingly, the court dismissed the appeals  from conviction and sentence . \n[7] I agree with the Court of Appeal that Mr. Campbe ll had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in his text message conversation with the user of Mr. Gammie’s \nphone. The police conducted a “search” of that conversation and hence Mr. Campbell \nhas standing to challenge the search under s. 8 of the Charter . Nev ertheless, the search \nwas not an “interception” of electronic communications under Part VI of the Criminal \nCode , nor was it incidental to the lawful arrest of Mr. Gammie.  \n[8] Even so, the warrantless search of Mr. Campbell’s text message \nconversation was just ified by exigent circumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . The \ntrial judge found that the police reasonably believed that they faced an urgent situation \ncalling for their immediate intervention to protect public safety based on two \nconsiderations. First, t he police reasonably believed that the drugs being sold were \nheroin laced with fentanyl, an especially deadly mix that has killed many vulnerable \nindividuals struggling with drug abuse across the country. Second, the police also \nreasonably believed that, i f they did not intervene immediately, these drugs would be \nsold imminently to vulnerable individuals in the community and hence posed a grave \nrisk to public safety. These findings cumulatively established the exigent circumstances \nin this case and made it impracticable to obtain a warrant. The trial judge was entitled \nto make these findings based on the evidence before him and correctly concluded that \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n they met the legal standard for a warrantless search under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . \nAccordingly, I would dismi ss the appeal.  \nII.

Facts  \n[9] On June 13 and 14, 2017, based on information obtained from confidential \ninformers, five members of the Guelph Police Service Drug Unit conducted \nsurveillance of Mr. Gammie, a known drug dealer. The informers had advised the \npolice tha t Mr. Gammie was trafficking in drugs, including heroin and fentanyl. On \nJune 13, the police saw what they believed was Mr. Gammie transacting with known \ndrug users. On June 14, the police applied for and obtained a warrant to search Mr. \nGammie’s residence  and arrested Mr. Gammie and a woman at 4:25 p.m. as they tried \nto leave the residence in a car. Mr. Gammie had cocaine and $2,295 in cash on him.  \n[10] During the arrest, Mr. Gammie threw two cellphones onto the passenger \nseat of the car. One of the arresting o fficers, Officer Kendall Brown, lawfully seized \nthe cellphones incident to arrest. A few minutes later, between 4:31 p.m. and 4:51 p.m., \none of the phones lit up with four text messages that were visible in plain view on the \ncellphone’s lock screen. The te xts were from a sender identified as Dew. They read:  \n[4:31:23 p.m.]  Family I need 1250 for this half tho  \n \n[4:50:26 p.m.]  Yooo  \n \n[4:50:48 p.m.]  What you gonna need that cause I don’t want to drive \naround with it  \n \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n [4:50:59 p.m.]  What time you gonna need it  \n \n(A.R., at p. 221)  \n[11] Officer Brown brought the texts to the attention of Officer Andrew Orok \nand Sergeant Ben Bair, an experienced drug investigator and the officer -in-charge of \nthe Guelph police drug squad. Sergeant Bair believed that the texts involved a dru g \ntransaction in progress, likely for heroin laced with fentanyl. He inferred this because \nthe phrase “1250 for this half” was consistent with a cheap price for half an ounce of \nheroin, which suggested that the heroin was likely mixed with fentanyl. He als o knew \nthat, in 2017, 75 percent of the heroin seized by the Guelph police contained fentanyl. \nHe was concerned that if the police did not obtain control of these drugs, they would \nbe sold in the community imminently and jeopardize public safety.  \n[12] Two othe r officers also suspected that the drugs involved heroin laced with \nfentanyl. Officer Orok suspected that the drugs were heroin based on the price of the \ndrugs and confidential informer information that Mr. Gammie was dealing in heroin, \nwhile Officer Dale Hunt had been told by two confidential informers that Mr. Gammie \nwas trafficking in cocaine, heroin, and crystal methamphetamine, along with fentanyl.  \n[13] Sergeant Bair instructed Officer Orok to respond to the texts by pretending \nto be Mr. Gammie and asking Dew to deliver the drugs to Mr. Gammie’s residence. He \nbelieved that Dew had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the texts sent to Mr. \nGammie’s phone, and therefore concluded that it was lawful for the police to \nimpersonate Mr. Gammie without a warrant . \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n [14] Over the next 2 hours and 15 minutes, Officer Orok exchanged 35 texts \nwith Dew about the delivery. He did so directly from the cellphone’s lock screen but \ndid not examine any other information on the cellphone.  \n[15] On the voir dire , Mr. Campbell testified th at a drug dealer named Dew had \ngiven him the cellphone to deliver drugs to Mr. Gammie. Mr. Campbell claimed that \nhe did not send the original four texts, but acknowledged that he sent and received the \nlater texts about the drug delivery to Mr. Gammie.  \n[16] Just after 7:00 p.m., Mr. Campbell arrived at Mr. Gammie’s residence and \nwas arrested.

Mr. Campbell claimed that \nhe did not send the original four texts, but acknowledged that he sent and received the \nlater texts about the drug delivery to Mr. Gammie.  \n[16] Just after 7:00 p.m., Mr. Campbell arrived at Mr. Gammie’s residence and \nwas arrested. During a search of Mr. Campbell’s person incident to arrest, the police \nfound $40 in cash and 14.33 grams of heroin mixed with fentanyl. They also seized \nMr. Campbell’s cell phone and photographed the screen to capture the text message \nconversation with Mr. Gammie’s phone. The police subsequently obtained warrants to \nsearch and download the texts from Mr. Gammie and Dew’s phones.  \nIII. Judicial History  \nA. Ontario Superior Court of Just ice, Voir Dire Ruling (Lemon  J.) \n[17] The trial judge held that Mr. Campbell lacked standing to claim that the \npolice violated his rights under s. 8 of the Charter  by using Mr. Gammie’s phone to \ntext him. He ruled that Mr. Campbell had no reasonable expectation of privacy when \ntexting the user of Mr. Gammie’s phone. Both parties agreed that the relevant authority \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n was this Court’s decision in R. v. Marakah , 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, released \na few months after Mr. Campbell’s arrest, which considered whether an accused had a \nreasonable expectation of privacy in a text message conversation with an accomplice \nto an illegal firearms transaction. This Court held th at text messages can attract a \nreasonable expectation of privacy when the claimant has a subjective expectation of \nprivacy and the subjective expectation is objectively reasonable in all the \ncircumstances.  \n[18] The trial judge accepted that Mr. Campbell had a s ubjective expectation of \nprivacy in his text message conversation. He noted that “conversations between two \ndrug traffickers would, as between the two of them, be expected to be kept private” \n(voir dire reasons (reproduced in A.R., at pp.  1-36), at  para. 3 9). At the same time, he \nfound that this expectation was not objectively reasonable. The texts “did not reveal \nany personal or biographical information” about Mr. Campbell and involved “mundane \ncomments that .  . . could have been overheard on a public bus”  (para. 44). As a result, \nMr. Campbell lacked standing to allege that his rights under s. 8 of the Charter  had \nbeen infringed.  \n[19] Although this conclusion was sufficient to dismiss Mr. Campbell’s \narguments under s. 8 of the Charter , the trial judge observed t hat the jurisprudence in \nthis area of the law was rapidly evolving, and therefore considered Mr. Campbell’s \nother arguments on the basis that he had standing.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n [20] The trial judge accepted that the police searched Mr. Gammie’s phone and \nrejected the Crown’s sub mission that the entire text message conversation was in “plain \nview”. He found that although the first four texts from Dew may have been in plain \nview, the later texts between Officer Orok and Mr. Campbell were produced by using \nthe phone itself as part o f the investigation. These texts were “effectively a search of \nthe phone” (para. 63).  \n[21] The trial judge ruled that the warrantless search of Mr. Gammie’s phone \nwas justified by exigent circumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . He accepted the \nevidence of the  police officers that they reasonably believed the drugs Dew was \noffering to sell to Mr. Gammie involved heroin laced with fentanyl. He also found that, \n“[w]ithout immediate action, the transaction and the drugs were at risk” (para. 100). \nThe texts showed that Dew was impatient and a telewarrant “would likely arrive too \nlate to complete this transaction” (para. 100). As a result, “[t]he likelihood that the \ntransaction involved fentanyl and its dramatic effects on the community ma[de] this a \nmatter of public  safety” (para. 100). The police were therefore justified under s. 11(7) \nin engaging in a text message conversation with Mr. Campbell without a warrant.  \n[22] The trial judge rejected Mr.",

As a result, “[t]he likelihood that the \ntransaction involved fentanyl and its dramatic effects on the community ma[de] this a \nmatter of public  safety” (para. 100). The police were therefore justified under s. 11(7) \nin engaging in a text message conversation with Mr. Campbell without a warrant.  \n[22] The trial judge rejected Mr. Campbell’s argument that the police had \nundertaken an “interception” of h is electronic communications requiring prior judicial \nauthorization under Part VI (“Invasion of Privacy”) of the Criminal Code . He noted \nthat Part VI was designed to regulate the use of intrusive technologies to surveil and \ninterfere with communications be tween a sender and a recipient. Although the police \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n engaged in a deception by impersonating Mr. Gammie, they did not undertake an \n“interception” under Part VI. As a result, the police did not require prior judicial \nauthorization before using Mr. Gammie’s p hone to text Mr. Campbell.  \n[23] Nevertheless, the trial judge accepted that the police breached \nMr. Campbell’s rights under s. 8 of the Charter  when they scrolled through and took \nphotographs of the texts on Dew’s phone upon Mr. Campbell’s arrest. (This point w as \nnot pursued before the Court of Appeal or this Court. As noted, the police later obtained \na valid warrant to search and download the contents of Dew’s phone.)  \n[24] Finally, the trial judge held that even had he found each of the claimed \nbreaches of Mr. Campb ell’s rights under s. 8, he would not have excluded the texts \nfrom evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter . \n[25] With the texts and drugs admitted into evidence, Mr. Campbell was \nconvicted of trafficking in heroin and fentanyl and possession of heroin and fentan yl \nfor the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(1) and (2) of the CDSA . He was sentenced \nto six years of imprisonment, less credit of four months for restrictive bail conditions \nand pre -trial custody.  \nB. Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 666 , 163 O.R . (3d) 355  (Trotter J.A., \nLauwers and Roberts JJ.A. Concurring)  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n [26] The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Campbell’s appeals from conviction \nand sentence. The court agreed with the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no \nbreach of s. 8 of the Charter , but did s o for different reasons. It also dismissed the other \ngrounds of appeal.  \n[27] The court ruled that Mr. Campbell had standing to argue that the police \nviolated his rights under s. 8. Applying Marakah , the court accepted that Mr. Campbell \nhad an objectively reason able expectation of privacy in the circumstances. The \ncomments made in Mr. Campbell’s texts were not “mundane”, but rather were about a \ndrug deal, “something one might make efforts to prevent from being overheard on a \nbus” (para. 40).  \n[28] The court also reject ed the Crown’s argument that R. v. Mills , 2019 SCC \n22, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 320 — in which the police had posed online as a 14 -year-old girl \nas part of an internet child luring investigation — should alter the application of \nMarakah  to this case. The court inte rpreted Mills  as having carved out an “exception” \nto Marakah  when the electronic communications themselves constitute a crime against \nthe recipient — in that case, the victimization of children — which was far removed \nfrom this case (para. 62). Here, the c ourt noted, the police “inserted themselves into a \nconversation that was already underway, between two real people with a pre -existing \nrelationship, essentially hijacking the identity of one of the participants. .  . .

[T]he \npolice became part of the exchan ge, but unbeknownst to the appellant” (para. 71).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n \n [29] Finally, the court held that it was open to the trial judge to find no breach \nof s. 8 of the Charter  because the police had acted under exigent circumstances. The \npolice had to act immediately to protect pu blic safety and it was impracticable to obtain \na warrant. The police officers believed that the texts conveyed an in -progress \ntransaction for heroin laced with fentanyl and without immediate action by the police \nthe drugs would have been trafficked in the community. The police officers’ evidence, \ncombined with “the notoriously harmful nature of fentanyl”, amounted to exigent \ncircumstances (para. 83). The court stated that “[a]lthough the trial judge’s conclusion \nrelied on some contingencies, it was not undu ly speculative, nor was it unreasonable” \n(para. 83). The court ruled that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that “ immediate  \naction was required” and “it was impracticable to obtain a warrant, even a telewarrant” \n(para. 84 (emphasis in original)).  \n[30] Counsel for Mr. Campbell did not press in oral argument before the Court \nof Appeal whether the police had conducted an “interception” under Part VI of the \nCriminal Code , and as a result, the court did not address this point.  \n[31] Having found no s. 8 breach, the court did not address whether to exclude \nthe evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter . \nIV. Issues  \n[32] This appeal raises the following questions:  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n 1. Does Mr. Campbell have standing to allege that the police conducted \na “search” that violated his rights under s. 8 of the Charter ? \n \n2. Was the search not authorized by law, and therefore “unreasonable” \nunder s. 8? In particular, was the search: (a) an “interc eption” under \nPart VI of the Criminal Code ; (b) not incident to a lawful arrest; or \n(c) not justified by “exigent circumstances” that made it \n“impracticable” to obtain a warrant under s. 11(7) of the CDSA ? \n \n3. Should the evidence obtained be excluded under s.  24(2) of the \nCharter ? \nV. Analysis  \nA. Did Mr. Campbell Have a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in His Text \nMessage Conversation?  \n[33] The first issue is whether Mr. Campbell has standing to allege that the \npolice infringed his rights under s. 8 of the Charter  by usi ng Mr. Gammie’s phone to \nengage in the text message conversation that led to Mr. Campbell’s arrest. \nMr. Campbell testified at the voir dire  that he was not Dew and that he did not send the \nfirst four texts from Dew’s phone to Mr. Gammie’s phone. At the sam e time, he \nadmitted that he sent the later texts to Mr. Gammie’s phone, and therefore claimed \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n standing to challenge the admission of these later texts into evidence. Both courts below \nevaluated Mr. Campbell’s standing on that basis. I will do likewise.  \n[34] Mr. Campbell has standing if he establishes that he had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in his text message conversation with who he thought was Mr. \nGammie, in which case the police conducted a “search” under s. 8 of the Charter . It \nwould then be necessa ry to consider whether the search was “unreasonable” under s. 8 \nof the Charter  (see R. v.  Cole , 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at paras. 35 -36; \nMarakah , at paras.  10 and 12; R. v. Bykovets , 2024 SCC 6, at para. 30).  \n[35] As I will explain, I agree with the Co urt of Appeal that Mr. Campbell had \na reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message conversation, and he therefore \nhas standing to allege that the police infringed his rights under s. 8 of the Charter . \n(1) Legal Principles  \n[36] Section 8 of the Charter  guarantees that “[e]very",

Bykovets , 2024 SCC 6, at para. 30).  \n[35] As I will explain, I agree with the Co urt of Appeal that Mr. Campbell had \na reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message conversation, and he therefore \nhas standing to allege that the police infringed his rights under s. 8 of the Charter . \n(1) Legal Principles  \n[36] Section 8 of the Charter  guarantees that “[e]veryone has the right to be \nsecure against unreasonable search or seizure.” The main purpose of s. 8 is to protect \nthe right to privacy from unjustified state intrusion ( Hunter v. Southam Inc. , [1984] 2 \nS.C.R. 145, at p. 160; R. v. Plant , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 291; Bykovets , at para. 29).  \n[37] The right to privacy is foundational to a free and democratic society. It is \nessential to “individual dignity, autonomy, and personal growth” ( Bykovets , at para. 29; \nsee also Plant , at p. 292; R. v. Jones, 2017 SCC 60, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 696, at para. 38), \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n and to “the relationship between the state and the citizen” ( R. v. Tessling , 2004 SCC \n67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 12). In an oft -quoted passage in R. v. Dyment , [1988] \n2 S.C.R. 417, at pp. 427 -28, La Forest J. wrote that “[t]he restraints imposed on \ngovernment to pry into the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a democratic state.” \nA similar sentiment was echoed by Binnie J. in Tessling , who observed that “[f]ew \nthings are as important to our way of life as the amount of power allowed the police to \ninvade the homes, privacy and even the bodily integrity of members of Canadian \nsociety without judicial authorization” (para. 13).  \n[38] A central preoccupation of this Court’s s.  8 jurisprudence has been to \nbalance the often competing aims of personal privacy and the public interest. This quest \nfor balance reflects the constitutional imperative in s. 8 itself, which, expressed \nnegatively, protects against an unreasonable  search and seizure or, expressed \npositively, safeguards only a reasonable  expectation of privacy ( Hunter , at p. 159). In \nHunter , Dickson J., as he then was, explained that s. 8 requires “an assessment .  . . as \nto whether in a particular situation the public’s interest in being left alone by  \ngovernment must give way to the government’s interest in intruding on the individual’s \nprivacy in order to advance its goals, notably those of law enforcement” (pp.  159-60). \nIn Tessling , Binnie J. added that “[t]he community wants privacy but it also insi sts on \nprotection. Safety, security and the suppression of crime are legitimate countervailing \nconcerns” (para. 17; see also Plant , at pp. 291 -92). \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n [39] Section 8 of the Charter  is engaged where a person has a “reasonable \nprivacy interest in the object or subject matter of the state action and the information to \nwhich it gives access” ( Marakah , at para. 10, quoting Cole , at para. 34). A claimant \nseeking standing to argue that the ir rights under s. 8 were infringed must show that they \nsubjectively expected the subject matter of the search would remain private, and that \ntheir expectation was objectively reasonable having regard to “the totality of the \ncircumstances” ( Marakah , at par a. 10, quoting R. v. Edwards , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at \nparas. 31 and 45; see also R. v. Spencer , 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at paras. \n17-18; Jones , at para. 13). In making this evaluation, courts are guided by four lines of \ninquiry: (1) the subject m atter of the alleged search; (2) whether the claimant had a \ndirect interest in the subject matter; (",

In making this evaluation, courts are guided by four lines of \ninquiry: (1) the subject m atter of the alleged search; (2) whether the claimant had a \ndirect interest in the subject matter; (3) whether the claimant had a subjective \nexpectation of privacy in the subject matter; and (4) whether the claimant’s subjective \nexpectation of privacy was objectively reasonable ( Marakah , at para. 11; Cole , at para. \n40; Spencer , at para. 18; Bykovets , at para. 31).  \n(2) Application  \n[40] I agree with the Crown that this Court has held that there is no “automatic” \nrule of standing for text messages. As McLachlin C.J. re cognized in Marakah , text \nmessage conversations “ can, in some circumstances, attract a reasonable expectation \nof privacy”, but this “does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that an exchange of \nelectronic messages will always  attract a reasonable expecta tion of privacy” (para. 5 \n(emphasis in original)). Whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n in a text message conversation must be assessed based on the totality of the \ncircumstances in each case.  \n[41] In my view, the four lines of inquiry  under s. 8 establish that Mr. Campbell \nhad a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text message conversation with who he \nthought was Mr. Gammie. Although the only disputed point is the objective \nreasonableness of his subjective expectation of privacy, I will briefly address each of \nthe other points as well.  \n(a) What Was the Subject Matter of the Alleged Search?  \n[42] When the state examines text messages, the subject matter of the alleged \nsearch is properly characterized as “the electronic conversation between tw o or more \npeople” ( Marakah , at para. 19; see also Jones , at para. 14; R. v. TELUS \nCommunications Co. , 2013 SCC 16, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 5 ). As noted in \nMarakah , “[t]his includes the existence of the conversation, the identities of the \nparticipants, the information shared, and any inferences about associations and \nactivities that can be drawn from that information” (para. 20).  \n[43] Here, the subject matter of the alleged search was Mr. Campbell’s text \nmessage conversation with who he believed was Mr. Gammie.  \n(b) Did Mr. Campbell Have a Direct Interest in the Subject Matter?  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n [44] The Crown does not dispute that Mr. Campbell had a direct interest in his \ntext message conversation. He participated in the conversation and wrote several of the \ntexts at issue (see Marakah , at para. 21; Jones , at para. 15).  \n(c) Did Mr. Campbell Have a Subjective Expectation of Privacy in the Subject \nMatter?  \n[45] A claimant’s burden of establishing a subjective expectation of privacy in \nthe subject matter of the alleged search “is not ‘a high hur dle’” ( Marakah , at para. 22, \nquoting R. v. Patrick , 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 37; see also Jones , \nat para. 20). The necessary evidentiary foundation is “modest”, reflecting how “s. 8’s \nnormative import transcends an individual claimant’s s ubjective expectations” ( Jones , \nat para. 21). “A subjective expectation of privacy can be presumed or inferred in the \ncircumstances in the absence of the claimant’s testimony or admission at the voir dire ” \n(para. 21).  \n[46] The trial judge accepted Mr. Campbell’ s evidence that he had a subjective \nexpectation of privacy. He found that, “[g]iven the nature of the conversation, and the \nlow threshold”, he could “presume that conversations between two drug traffickers \nwould, as between the two of them, be expected to be kept private” ( voir dire reasons, \nat para. 39).

This finding is not challenged before this Court.  \n(d) Was Mr. Campbell’s Subjective Expectation of Privacy Objectively \nReasonable?  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n [47] In determining whether a subjective expectation of privacy is objectively \nreasonable, courts must employ an approach that is both normative and content -neutral. \nSeveral interveners urge this Court to affirm these basic postulates of the s. 8 analysis. \nI agree that it is useful to do so.  \n(i) Section 8 Requires a Normative Approach  \n[48] Whethe r there is a reasonable expectation of privacy “is not a purely factual \ninquiry”; the inquiry “is normative rather than simply descriptive” ( Spencer , at para. \n18; see also Tessling , at para. 42). Although the inquiry must be sensitive to the factual \ncontex t, it is inevitably laden with value judgments about the sort of free and \ndemocratic society that reasonable and informed Canadians expect to live in, based on \nconcerns about the long -term consequences of tolerating state intrusion into individual \nprivacy (Spencer , at para. 18; Patrick , at para. 27; Bykovets , at para. 52; see also H. \nStewart, “Normative Foundations for Reasonable Expectations of Privacy” (2011), 54 \nS.C.L.R. (2d) 335, at pp. 342 -47; S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, \nCriminal Procedure in Canada  (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶3.38).  \n[49] The normative approach to s. 8 “demands we take a broad, functional \napproach to the subject matter of the search and that we focus on its  potential  to reveal \npersonal or biographical core information” ( Bykovet s, at para. 7 (emphasis in original), \nciting Marakah , at para. 32; see also R. v. Reeves , 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, \nat para. 28; Tessling , at para. 42; Spencer , at para. 18; Stewart, at pp. 335 and 342 -43). \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n (ii) The Approach to Section 8 Must Also Be Co ntent -Neutral  \n[50] It is also settled that “the s. 8 analysis must be content -neutral” ( Marakah , \nat para. 48). Thus, “the fruits of a search cannot be used to justify an unreasonable \nprivacy violation” (para. 48). This Court’s precedents on the content -neutral approach \nhold that people do not deserve lesser privacy protection under s. 8 of the Charter  \nbecause they were engaged in criminal activity at the time of the search or seizure.  \n[51] A leading authority on the content -neutral approach to s. 8 is R. v. Wong , \n[1990] 3 S.C.R. 36. This Court held that the accused had a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy in a hotel room in which the police had installed a video camera without judicial \nauthorization during an investigation of a “floating” gaming house. The Court \nemphas ized that whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy “must be \nframed in broad and neutral terms” (p. 50). The question is not “whether persons who \nengage in illegal activity behind the locked door of a hotel room have a reasonable \nexpectation  of privacy” (a content -driven approach), but rather “whether in a society \nsuch as ours persons who retire to a hotel room and close the door behind them have a \nreasonable expectation of privacy” (a content -neutral approach) (p. 50).  \n[52] Under the content -neutral approach to s. 8, the existence of a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy does not turn on “the legal or illegal nature of the items sought” \n(Spencer , at para. 36; see also Reeves , at para. 28; Patrick , at para. 32; R. v.

The Private Nature of the Subject Matter  \n[55] The private nature of the subject matter is a critical factor in establishing a \nreasonable expectation of privacy. The purpose of s. 8 is “to protect a  biographical core \nof personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society would wish \nto maintain and control from dissemination to the state” ( Plant , at p. 293; see also \nMarakah , at para. 31; Bykovets , at para. 51). As this Court has re cognized, “all \ninformation about a person is in a fundamental way his own, for him to communicate \nor retain for himself as he sees fit” ( Dyment , at p. 429, quoting the Task Force \nestablished jointly by the Department of Communications/Department of Justice , \nPrivacy and Computers  (1972), at p.  13; see also Spencer , at para. 40; Jones , at para. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n 39; Tessling , at para. 23). In this vein, s. 8 of the Charter  has been described as \nprotecting “informational self -determination” ( Jones , at para. 39).  \n[56] In keeping with  the normative, content -neutral approach to s. 8, a court \nmust focus on “‘whether people generally have a privacy interest’ in the subject matter \nof the state’s search” ( Bykovets , at para. 53, quoting Patrick , at para. 32).

    "text": " approach to s. 8, a court \nmust focus on “‘whether people generally have a privacy interest’ in the subject matter \nof the state’s search” ( Bykovets , at para. 53, quoting Patrick , at para. 32). The question \nis whether the subj ect matter of the search at issue has the potential  or tendency  to \nreveal private information about the claimant ( Marakah , at para. 31).  \n[57] With respect to text messages in particular, “the focus is not on the actual \ncontents of the messages the police have s eized, but rather on the potential of a given \nelectronic conversation to reveal personal or biographical information”; the focus is on \nwhether the participants in the conversation “have a reasonable expectation of privacy \nin its contents, whatever they may  be” ( Marakah , at para. 32). The protection of s. 8 \nincludes “information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and \npersonal choices of the individual” (para. 32, quoting Plant , at p. 293).  \n[58] This Court has recognized that few if any types of conversation or \ncommunication can “promis[e] more privacy than text messaging. There is no more \ndiscreet form of correspondence” ( Marakah , at para. 35; see also TELUS \nCommunications , at para. 1). “Electronic conversations can allow people to \ncommunicate  details about their activities, their relationships, and even their identities \nthat they would never reveal to the world at large, and to enjoy portable privacy in \ndoing so” ( Marakah , at para. 36).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n [59] Here, the alleged search of Mr. Campbell’s text message conversation \nintruded into a medium of communication in which a reasonable person would \nordinarily expect the utmost privacy. A text message conversation has the potential or \ntendency to reveal deeply personal and biographical information about the partici pants. \nThis is the type of information that anyone would reasonably expect to be kept private \nfrom the state.  \n[60] Although I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in \nfinding that Mr. Campbell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the \ncircumstances, in my respectful view, both courts erred by focussing on the actual \ncontents of the text messages at issue, rather than the potential or tendency for the \nconversation to reveal deeply personal and biographical core information about the \nparticipants. The trial judge stated that Mr. Campbell’s text message conversation “did \nnot reveal any personal or biographical information about him nor was it likely to” \nbecause it involved “mundane comments that, in another age, could have been \noverheard on  a public bus” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 44). For its part, the Court of \nAppeal focussed on how the conversation was “about a drug deal, something one might \nmake efforts to prevent from being overheard on a bus” (para. 40). As this Court has \nstated, how ever, the longstanding content -neutral approach to s. 8 requires a court to \nanalyze whether the type of information at issue has the potential or tendency to reveal \nprivate information about the claimant, whatever the actual contents of the conversation \nmay be ( Marakah , at paras. 31 -32).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n [61] In my view, the private nature of the subject matter at issue has the potential \nor tendency to reveal private information about Mr. Campbell, and therefore supports \nhis claim to a reasonable expectation of privacy in his t ext message conversation.  \n2. Intrusiveness of the Police Technique in Relation to the Privacy Interest  \n[62] The intrusiveness of the police technique in relation to the privacy interest \nat issue can be important in assessing whether a claimant’s subjective expecta tion of \nprivacy is objectively reasonable ( Tessling , at paras. 32 and 50; Plant , at p. 295). This \nis a distinct consideration from whether the police acted lawfully, which is relevant to \nwhether the state conduct was “unreasonable” at the second stage of t he s. 8 inquiry \n(Edwards , at para. 33).  \n[63] In this case, the police investigative technique was especially intrusive. The \npolice did not simply review texts that Mr. Campbell sent to Mr. Gammie’s phone, nor \nwas Mr. Campbell texting a complete stranger. As the  Court of Appeal stated, “the \npolice became part of the exchange, but unbeknownst to the appellant” (para.",

    "text": " of t he s. 8 inquiry \n(Edwards , at para. 33).  \n[63] In this case, the police investigative technique was especially intrusive. The \npolice did not simply review texts that Mr. Campbell sent to Mr. Gammie’s phone, nor \nwas Mr. Campbell texting a complete stranger. As the  Court of Appeal stated, “the \npolice became part of the exchange, but unbeknownst to the appellant” (para. 71). The \npolice “‘intrude[d] on a private conversation’. They inserted themselves into a \nconversation that was already underway, between two real peo ple with a pre -existing \nrelationship, essentially hijacking the identity of one of the participants” (para. 71). \nThis factor also supports Mr. Campbell’s claim to a reasonable expectation of privacy \nin all the circumstances.  \n3. Control Over the Information  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n [64] The Crown highlights that Mr. Campbell was using a borrowed phone, \nwhich it says undercuts his claim to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Crown \nasserts that it was not objectively reasonable for Mr. Campbell to expect that his \nconversation with Mr. Ga mmie would remain private because he insisted that the phone \nbelonged to Dew and that he was merely borrowing it to complete the drug delivery \n(R.F., at paras. 41 -42). It cites McLachlin C.J.’s observation in Marakah , that a \nreasonable expectation of priva cy “may exist on a spectrum or in a ‘hierarchy’ of \nplaces” (para. 29, quoting Tessling , at para. 22 ). A person may have a high expectation \nof privacy on their own phone, which they “completely control, a lesser expectation of \nprivacy in [a] friend’s phone” , which the friend controls, and no reasonable expectation \nof privacy at all if the claimant “expect[s] the text message to be displayed to the \npublic” (para. 29). The Crown says that Mr. Campbell could not possibly have had an \nobjectively reasonable expec tation of privacy on a borrowed phone with a “virtual \nstranger” (R.F., at para. 29).  \n[65] I do not accept this submission. Mr. Campbell testified that even though he \ndid not know Dew’s full name, he knew Dew and had made several drug deliveries for \nhim in the p ast. Mr. Campbell was therefore using the phone of someone with whom \nhe had a prior relationship.  \n[66] The Crown’s position also fails to appreciate that control is not \ndeterminative of the question of standing. As McLachlin C.J. emphasized in Marakah , \n“control  is not an absolute indicator of a reasonable expectation of privacy, nor is lack \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n of control fatal to a privacy interest” (para. 38; see also Reeves , at para. 37). “[A]  person \ndoes not lose control of information for the purposes of s. 8 simply because ano ther \nperson possesses it or can access it” ( Marakah , at para. 41; see also para. 68). Sharing \ncontrol of the information at issue may diminish  without necessarily eliminating a \nperson’s reasonable expectation of privacy. As a result, text message conversat ions \nmay be protected by a “zone of privacy” that extends beyond one’s own mobile device \nto the recipient of the message, even when “one shares private information with others” \n(para. 37).  \n[67] Mr. Campbell’s reasonable expectation of privacy thus extended from  the \nuse of Dew’s phone to the texts that he sent and received as part of his electronic \nconversation with who he believed was Mr. Gammie. He did not lose the protection of \ns. 8 of the Charter  simply by sharing private information with the other party to h is text \nmessage conversation or by using the phone of an acquaintance.  \n[68] The relevant question under s. 8 is not whether the individual reasonably \nexpected the subject matter of the search to remain private from just anybody; what \nmatters is whether they rea sonably expected it would remain private from state  \nintrusion (R. v. Duarte , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 46; Wong , at pp. 43 -44 and 47 -48; \nPlant , at p. 291; Tessling , at para. 18; Marakah , at paras. 40 -45).

The “zone of privacy” \nprotected by s. 8 of the Charter  involves the right to keep “personal information .  . . \nsafe from state intrusion” ( Marakah , at para. 37). In my view, in all the circumstances, \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n Mr. Campbell had a reasonable expectation of privacy from state intrusion into his text \nmessage conversa tion. \n(e) Undercover Police Work Is Not Imperilled  \n[69] The Crown further argues that the police impersonation of Mr. Gammie \nwas simply an undercover police investigation, and was therefore not a search under s. \n8. It cites the comments of Karakatsanis J. on behalf of a minority of the Court in Mills , \nthat “s. 8 does not prevent police from communicating with individuals in the course \nof an undercover investigation”, and that “an individual cannot reasonably expect their \nwords to be kept private from the person with whom they are communicating” (para. \n42). The C rown says that simply because an interlocutor turns out to be an undercover \npolice officer does not convert a text message conversation into a search, and that \naccepting Mr. Campbell’s privacy claim would lead to “a society bereft of undercover \npolice work ” (R.F., at para. 55).  \n[70] Like the Court of Appeal, I would reject this argument. I accept that there \nis nothing necessarily improper in the police answering the phone of an arrested person \nand speaking with an unsuspecting caller, as occurred in R. v. Baldre e, 2013 SCC 35, \n[2013] 2 S.C.R. 520. But speaking with a caller on a telephone is constitutionally \ndifferent from creating a permanent electronic record of the communication through a \nsurreptitious sound recording or by using the medium of text messaging. The \nsurreptitious recording of a communication by the police is a search and seizure for \nconstitutional purposes. As La Forest J. stated in Duarte , “[a] conversation with an \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n informer does not amount to a search and seizure within the meaning of the Charter . \nSurreptitious electronic interception and recording of a private communication does” \n(p. 57). Likewise, as Arbour J. stated in R. v. Fliss , 2002 SCC 16, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 535, \nat para. 12, “a conversation with an informer, or a police officer, is not a sea rch and \nseizure. Only the recording of such conversation is”.  \n[71] In this case, the police did not surreptitiously record Mr. Campbell’s \nconversation. Instead, the medium of communication of text messaging itself generated \nthe record of the conversation ( TELU S Communications , at para. 34). That medium \npotentially gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, but this does not in itself \nprevent undercover police work. Instead, it merely imposes constitutional constraints \non police investigations involving text messaging by requiring the police to comply \nwith s. 8 of the Charter  (see Marakah ; Jones ). \n(f) It Is Not Necessary To Decide Whether Mills Created an “Exception” to \nMarakah or Departed From the Content -Neutral Approach to Section 8  \n[72] Lastly, the Crown submi ts that the Court of Appeal erred when it said that \n“Mills  carved out an exception [to Marakah ] in circumstances where the electronic \ncommunications themselves constitute a crime against the recipient — in that case, the \nvictimization of children” (C.A. re asons, at para. 62; see also paras. 34 and 73). Instead, \nthe Crown submits that Marakah  and Mills  “demonstrate how the totality of the \ncircumstances test is sufficiently fluid to allow the Court to adapt it to a changing \n[technological] landscape while sta ying true to the principles that s. 8 seeks to protect” \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n (R.F., at para. 36).

Several interveners similarly caution that characterizing Mills  as an \n“exception” to Marakah  would dilute the content -neutral approach to s. 8 of the \nCharter , inviting courts to f ind that communications between parties do not deserve s. \n8 protection when police suspect that their relationship involves a crime. Such a \ncharacterization, they warn, would lead courts to ask whether particular relationships \nare morally deserving of prot ection under s. 8, undercutting decades of Charter  \njurisprudence.  \n[73] Mills  involved an undercover sting operation in which the police posed as \na 14-year-old girl to investigate child luring on the internet. The police communicated \nwith the accused online and used screen capture software to record the communications \nwithout judicial authorization. The communications led to an arranged meeting at \nwhich the police arrested the accused and charged him with child luring. When the \nCrown sought to introduce the elect ronic communications into evidence at trial, the \naccused claimed that the police had infringed his rights under s. 8 of the Charter  by \nintercepting his private electronic communications without judicial authorization. A \nmajority of this Court found no brea ch of s. 8.  \n[74] Four sets of reasons were issued in Mills , with no majority decision. Justice \nBrown, for a plurality of the Court, expressly applied the “totality of circumstances” \nand normative approach to objective reasonableness under s. 8 and concluded th at the \naccused had no reasonable expectation of privacy in all the circumstances (paras. 13 \nand 20). He rested his conclusion on what he described as a “modest” proposition that \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n the accused could not establish “an objectively reasonable expectation of priv acy in \nthese particular circumstances, where he conversed with a child  online who was a \nstranger  to him and, most importantly , where the police knew this when they created \nher” (para. 30 (emphasis in original)). In the course of his reasons, Brown  J. also cited \nMarakah  approvingly (paras. 12 -14 and 16).  \n[75] Justice Karakatsanis, for a minority of the Court, concluded that the \naccused had no reasonable expectation of privacy since he was like someone who \n“unwittingly speaks to an undercover officer in person” (p ara. 44). She found that \nbecause the accused “had no reasonable expectation that his messages would be kept \nprivate from the intended recipient, s. 8 is not engaged” (para. 44). The accused had \nchosen to use a written medium to communicate and knew that a permanent electronic \nrecord of his communications existed (paras. 48 and 55). Justice Karakatsanis similarly \ndid not depart from the totality of the circumstances approach to s. 8 and also cited \nMarakah  approvingly (paras. 49 and 60).  \n[76] Justice Moldaver, co ncurring in the result, stated that each of the reasons \nof Brown J. and Karakatsanis J. was “sound in law” (para. 66).  \n[77] Finally, Martin J., also concurring in the result, would have found a breach \nof s. 8, but would not have excluded the evidence under s. 2 4(2) of the Charter .  \n[78] As a result, there was no majority decision in Mills . As the Court of Appeal \ncorrectly noted, however, neither Brown J. nor Karakatsanis J. “attempted to distance \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n themselves” from Marakah  (para. 60). In my view, Marakah  remains the go verning \nauthority on when a text message conversation attracts a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy under s. 8. It is thus not necessary to decide whether Mills  is properly \ncharacterized as creating an “exception” to Marakah  or as departing from the \ncontent -neutral approach to s. 8 of the Charter . \n(3) Conclusion  \n[79] Mr. Campbell had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his \ntext message conversation with who he thought",

It is thus not necessary to decide whether Mills  is properly \ncharacterized as creating an “exception” to Marakah  or as departing from the \ncontent -neutral approach to s. 8 of the Charter . \n(3) Conclusion  \n[79] Mr. Campbell had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his \ntext message conversation with who he thought was Mr. Gammie. The police intruded \nupon Mr. Campbell’s reasonable expectation of pr ivacy by pretending to be Mr. \nGammie to continue that conversation . As a result, the police conducted a “search” \nunder s. 8, which Mr. Campbell has standing to challenge.  \nB. Was the Search Unreasonable?  \n[80] The next issue is whether the warrantless search conduct ed by the police \nwas “unreasonable” and therefore contrary to s. 8 of the Charter . \n[81] A warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable, shifting the burden of \npersuasion to the Crown to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the search was \nreasonabl e (R. v. Collins , [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). A search is reasonable under \ns. 8 if it is authorized by a reasonable law and conducted in a reasonable manner (p. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n \n 278; R. v. Fearon , 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 12; R. v. Caslake , [1998] \n1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 10).  \n[82] Mr. Campbell argues that the search was not authorized by law, and was \ntherefore unreasonable, on two grounds. He says that the deceptive text messaging by \nthe police was an “interception” under Part  VI of the Criminal Code  because  it allowed \nthe police to acquire his texts in real time. He also contends that the warrantless search \nwas not justified by exigent circumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . In his view, the \nCourt of Appeal took a lax approach to exigency that would reliev e the police of the \nduty to obtain a warrant in any case involving dangerous drugs such as fentanyl. The \nCrown disagrees with these arguments, and adds that the search of Mr. Campbell’s text \nmessage conversation was authorized as incident to the lawful arr est of Mr. Gammie.  \n[83] In my view, the police investigative technique was neither an interception \nunder Part VI of the Criminal Code  nor a search incident to the lawful arrest of \nMr. Gammie. At the same time, I accept that the search was justified by exigent \ncircumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA . The search was therefore reasonable and \njustified by law and did not breach s. 8 of the Charter . I will address each point in turn.  \n(1) The Search Was Not an Interception Under Part VI of the Criminal Code  \n[84] Mr. Campbell says that the police investigative technique of engaging in a \ntext message conversation with him from Mr. Gammie’s phone was an “interception” \nunder the wiretapping regime in Part VI of the Criminal Code  and hence required \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n \n judicial authorization. He claims  that this violated his rights under s. 8 of the Charter  \nand exacerbated the seriousness of the breach of s. 8 under the s. 24(2) analysis.  \n[85] I disagree. The police investigative technique was not an “interception” \nunder Part VI because it did not involve t he use of a device employing an intrusive \nsurveillance technology.  \n(a) Legal Principles  \n[86] Parliament enacted Part VI of the Criminal Code , “Invasion of Privacy” \n(ss. 183 to 196.1), as a comprehensive regime to address the interception of private \ncommunications b y balancing the individual right to privacy with the collective need \nfor law enforcement ( Wakeling v. United States of America , 2014 SCC 72, [2014] 3 \nS.C.R. 549, at para. 26; Duarte , at p. 45; Imperial Oil v. Jacques , 2014 SCC 66, [2014] \n3 S.C.R. 287, at p ara. 39).

Jacques , 2014 SCC 66, [2014] \n3 S.C.R. 287, at p ara. 39). Part VI creates offences, establishes procedures for the \nauthorized interception of private communications in the investigation of certain \ncrimes, and delineates when intercepted communications may be admissible in \nevidence.  \n[87] Part VI (then Part IV.1) was enacted in 1974 at a time of widespread \nconcern about the use of intrusive surveillance technologies, such as wiretapping and \nbugging, to eavesdrop on citizens ( Duarte , at pp. 38 -39 and 43 -44; Jones , at para. 73; \nR. v. McQueen  (1975), 25 C.C.C. ( 2d) 262 (Alta. S.C. (App. Div.)), at p. 268). When \nintroducing the legislation, Minister of Justice Otto E. Lang stated that “the key and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n central portion of this bill is an attempt to increase the protection of privacy in Canada \nby making illegal in a gene ral way the use of a whole series of devices, particularly \nmechanical and electrical devices, that can intercept conversations of people who do \nnot want them to be intercepted” ( House of Commons Debates , vol.  IV, 1st Sess., 29th \nParl., May  8, 1973, at p.  3538, addressing Bill C -176).  \n[88] Soon after Part VI was enacted, the A lberta Supreme Court, Appellate \nDivision, in McQueen , described the legislation as “the culmination of widespread and \nprotracted efforts to impose some measure of statutory control over ind iscriminate \nresort to practices popularly known as wiretapping or bugging, which involves special \nequipment .  . ., the use of which is unknown to the person under surveillance” (p. 268). \nAs Côté J. noted more recently in this Court’s decision in Jones , “the policy motivating \nPart VI was a concern with the use of intrusive surveillance technologies and their \nimpact on citizens’ privacy” (para. 73; see also Duarte , at pp. 43 -44; Lyons v. The \nQueen , [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 664; R. v. Pires , 2005 SCC 66, [20 05] 3 S.C.R. 343, \nat para. 8; R. v. Tse , 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, at para. 26; TELUS \nCommunications , at paras. 2 and 45). Modern electronic surveillance technologies \n“have the potential, if uncontrolled, to annihilate privacy” ( Jones , at para. 74,  quoting \nWong , at p. 47; see also R. v. Hafizi , 2023 ONCA 639, 168 O.R. (3d) 435, at paras. \n110-13). The purpose of Part VI is thus to impose controls on the use of intrusive \nsurveillance technologies that threaten to impinge upon the privacy of individual s. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n [89] Under Part VI, s. 184(1)(a) creates an indictable offence punishable by up \nto five years imprisonment if a person “knowingly intercepts a private communication” \nby use of “any electro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device”. Section 183 \ndefines “electro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device”, “intercept”, and \n“private communication” for the purpose of Part VI as follows:  \nelectro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device  means any device \nor apparatus that is used or is capable of bei ng used to intercept a private \ncommunication, but does not include a hearing aid used to correct \nsubnormal hearing of the user to not better than normal hearing;  \n \nintercept  includes listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire \nthe substance, mea ning or purport thereof;  \n \n. . . \n \nprivate communication  means any oral communication, or any \ntelecommunication, that is made by an origin",

Where neither participant to a private communication \nconsents to the interception, ss. 185 and 186 set out requirements for an application for \njudicial authorization for so -called “third -party ele ctronic surveillance” under Part VI \n(see Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para.  12.54; R. v. Bordage  (2000), 146 \nC.C.C. (3d) 549 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Largie , 2010 ONCA 548, 101 O.R. (3d) 561, at \nparas. 39-58). \n[92] As this Court has noted, “[c]ompared with o ther search and seizure and \nwarrant provisions in the [ Criminal ] Code , the provisions in Part VI contain more \nstringent requirements to safeguard privacy interests” ( TELUS Communications , at \npara. 27, per Abella J.). For example, s. 186(1)(b) requires that  “other investigative \nprocedures have been tried and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely \nto succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out \nthe investigation of the offence using only other invest igative procedures”.

He argues that this Court should take a broad and functional \napproach to determining whether Part VI of the Criminal Code is engaged. Under this \nargument,  the police in this case committed a criminal offence by using Mr. Gammie’s \nphone to continue the text message conversation with Dew.  \n[95] I accept that the scope of an “interception” should not be approached \ntechnically to render Part VI “irrelevant to the pro tection of the right to privacy in new, \nelectronic and text -based communications technologies, which generate and store \ncopies of private communications as part of the transmission process” ( TELUS \nCommunications , at para. 33; see also para. 34). Even so, i n my view, Part VI is not \nengaged here because the police did not use a device employing intrusive surveillance \ntechnology. This is a prerequisite for an interception under Part VI.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n \n [96] As Côté J. highlighted in Jones , “interception relates to actions by which  a \nthird party interjects itself into the communication process in real -time through \ntechnological means ” (para. 72 (emphasis added)). Part VI requires “the use of an \n‘electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device’ other than a hearing -aid (i.e., \nnot merely the naked ear)” (Ewaschuk, at § 4:7 (emphasis deleted); see also S. C. \nHutchison et al., Search and Seizure Law in Canada  (loose -leaf), at §§ 4:15 and 4:17; \nVauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para.  12.2 ([ TRANSLATION ] “by means of a \ntechnical device”)).  \n[97] To illustrate, in R. v. Beairsto , 2018 ABCA 118, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 207, \nwhich was cited approvingly by the trial judge here ( voir dire reasons, at para. 104) and \nhas similar facts to the present case, the Alberta Court of Appeal held that unle ss the \npolice use intrusive surveillance technology, police deception or trickery does not \namount to an interception under Part VI. In Beairsto , the police had seized a cellphone \nfrom a suspect incident to his arrest. During the seizure, an officer noticed  that the \nphone was not locked and saw an ongoing text message conversation that suggested \ndrug trafficking. The officer engaged in text message conversations on the seized phone \nand another device, tricking the other party into sending the officer a kilog ram of \ncocaine and leading to that party’s arrest. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that the \npolice conduct was not an interception under Part VI because, absent the use of an \nintrusive surveillance technology, “deception does not amount to an interceptio n” \n(para. 24). As the court explained:  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n . . . it is important to distinguish between the disclosure of found private \ncommunications and the interception of same. Where an investigation \ninvolves a basic deception as to whom the appellant is communicating \nwith, absent intrusive technologies amounting to an “interference” between \nthe recipient and the sender, no interception is made out. [para. 25]  \n[98] The need for a separate “device or apparatus” that effects the interception \nby surreptitious technological means c an also be seen in the surrounding legislative \ncontext, such as the provision for judicial authorization, s. 186. Section 186(5.1) \nprovides that “an authorization that permits interception by means of an \nelectro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other devi ce includes the authority to install, \nmaintain or remove the device covertly ”. Similarly, s. 186(5.2) adds that the judge who \ngave the authorization under s. 186(5.1) may later give a further authorization “for the \ncovert removal” of the device after the e xpiry of the original authorization.

A “device \nor apparatus” can only be installed, maintained, or removed if it is distinct  from the \nmedium of communication it is used to intercept.  \n[99] In communicating with Mr. Campbell, the police did not use an intrusive \n“electro -magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device” that could be “ used or is \ncapable of being used to intercept a private communication”. They simply responded \nto text messages received on Mr. Gammie’s phone, the same medium of \ncommunication or devic e Mr. Campbell had used to make the communication. \nAlthough this was prima facie  an intrusion upon Mr. Campbell’s reasonable \nexpectation of privacy, it did not involve the use of covert surveillance technology, as \nrequired under Part VI.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n (c) Conclusion  \n[100]  The pol ice did not engage in an interception under Part VI of the Criminal \nCode . \n(2) The Search Was Not Incident to a Lawful Arrest  \n[101]  The Crown submits that the police did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter  \nbecause the investigative technique of engaging in a text message conversation with \nMr. Campbell using Mr. Gammie’s phone was a lawful search incident to the arrest of \nMr. Gammie. The Crown says that the police were entitled to search Mr. Gammie’s \nphone i ncident to his arrest in order to locate and arrest another suspect after becoming \naware of an impending drug transaction.  \n[102]  I do not accept this submission, which does not appear to have been raised \nin the courts below. In my view, the search of Mr. Gammie’ s phone was not a lawful \nsearch incident to arrest because it was not strictly incidental to Mr. Gammie’s arrest \nor for the purpose of collecting evidence against another perpetrator of the offence for \nwhich Mr. Gammie was arrested.  \n(a) Legal Principles  \n[103]  The po lice have authority at common law to search a person incident to a \nlawful arrest and to seize anything in their possession or in the surrounding area of the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n arrest to ensure the safety of the police and the arrested person, prevent the person’s \nescape, or provide evidence against them ( R. v. Stairs , 2022 SCC 11,  [2022] 1 S.C.R. \n169, at para. 34; Cloutier v. Langlois , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at pp. 180 -81). This power \nis “extraordinary” because it does not require a warrant or reasonable and probable \ngrounds ( Stairs, at para. 34, quoting Fearon , at paras. 16 and 45). It simply requires \n“some reasonable basis” for what the police did ( Caslake , at para. 20).  \n[104]  A search incident to arrest is lawful if: (1) the arrest itself was lawful; (2) \nthe search was truly incide ntal to the arrest, in that it was for a valid law enforcement \nobjective connected to the arrest; and (3) the search was conducted reasonably ( Fearon , \nat paras. 21 and 27; Stairs , at para. 35). Valid law enforcement objectives include \nensuring the safety o f the police or the public, preventing the destruction of evidence, \nand uncovering evidence that could be used at trial ( Fearon , at para. 75; Stairs , at \npara.  36). \n[105]  In Fearon , Cromwell J. held that the police power to search a cellphone \nincident to a lawful  arrest “must be used with great circumspection” (para. 80), and is \npermitted only under limited circumstances (para. 83). The police may search a \ncellphone incident to arrest “provided that the search — both what is searched and how \nit is searched — is strictly incidental to the arrest  and that the police keep detailed notes \nof what has been searched and why” (para. 4 (emphasis added)).

Justice Cromwell \nhighlighted that the search must be “linked to a valid law enforcement objective relating \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n to the offence  for which the suspect has been arrested ”, which “prevents routine \nbrowsing through a cell phone in an unfocussed way” (para. 57 (emphasis added)).  \n(b) Application  \n[106]  The Crown asserts that the police pursued the law enforcement objective \nof preserving public saf ety because the first four texts on Mr. Gammie’s phone alerted \nthe police to a possible sale of heroin laced with fentanyl, which posed a grave public \nsafety risk. The Crown submits that the subsequent text message conversation between \nthe police and Mr. C ampbell was incident to the lawful arrest of Mr. Gammie and in \npursuit of this public safety objective. The Crown cites in support the comments of \nCromwell J. in Fearon , that “[a] prompt search of a cell phone may lead investigators \nto other perpetrators  and to stolen and easily disposed of property” (para.  67 (emphasis \nadded)). The Crown says that this is what happened here.  \n[107]  I disagree. The search of Mr. Gammie’s cellphone was not a search \n“strictly” related to his arrest or the offence for which he was ar rested. It was a search \nto collect evidence against another suspected drug trafficker, Dew, who turned out to \nbe Mr. Campbell. Nor was Mr. Campbell “another perpetrator” of the offence for which \nMr. Gammie was arrested. Instead, Mr. Campbell was arrested f or separate drug \ntrafficking and possession offences.  \n(c) Conclusion  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n [108]  The police’s text message conversation with Mr. Campbell using \nMr. Gammie’s phone was not a lawful search incident to the arrest of Mr. Gammie.  \n(3) The Search Was Justified by “Exigent Circumsta nces” That Made It \n“Impracticable” To Obtain a Warrant  \n[109]  Finally, the Crown argues that the search of Mr. Gammie’s cellphone was \njustified by “exigent circumstances” that made it “impracticable” to obtain a warrant \nunder s. 11(7) of the CDSA . The Crown submi ts that the police were required to take \nimmediate action because they reasonably suspected that the drugs offered for sale by \nDew were heroin laced with fentanyl, and that had they not intervened, these drugs \nwould have been trafficked imminently in the c ommunity. Mr. Campbell responds that \nthe trial judge and Court of Appeal erred in how they applied the test for exigency under \ns. 11(7), as interpreted in this Court’s governing decision in R. v. Paterson , 2017 SCC \n15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202.  \n[110]  I agree with th e Crown. In my view, the trial judge’s findings were \ngrounded in the evidence and cumulatively met the legal threshold under s. 11(7).  \n(a) Legal Principles  \n(i) Section 11(7) of the CDSA  \n[111]  Section 11(1) of the CDSA  authorizes a justice to issue a warrant to search \na place for a controlled substance and to seize it.

Second, it must be shown that the \nconditions for obtaining a warrant existed, but that exigent circumstances “render[ed] \nit ‘impracticable’ to obtain a warrant”, meaning that it was “impossible in practice or \nunmanageable to obtain a warrant” (paras. 34 and 36; see also para. 28). Thus, the \n“exigent circumstances must be shown to cause impracticability” (para. 34). Justice \nBrown summarized the two requirements of s. 11(7) as follows:  \n. . . for a warrantless entry to satisfy s. 11(7), t he Crown must show that \nthe entry was compelled by urgency, calling for immediate police action to \npreserve evidence, officer safety or public safety. Further, this urgency \nmust be shown to have been such that taking the time to obtain a warrant \nwould pose  serious risk to those imperatives. [para. 37]  \n(iii) The Evidentiary Threshold: Reasonable and Probable Grounds  \n[113]  As urged by the Crown and the intervener Criminal Lawyers’ Association \n(Ontario) , the police must have reasonable and probable grounds, rather than me rely \nreasonable suspicion, for the claimed exigency under s. 11(7). The higher standard of \nreasonable and probable grounds helps ensure that the police are not relieved too \nreadily of the obligation to obtain a warrant, given the privacy and liberty intere sts \nengaged when weighed against the needs of law enforcement (see R. v. Grant , [1993] \n3 S.C.R. 223, at pp. 240 -43; R. v. MacDonald , 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37, at \nparas. 31 and 41; Tse, at para. 33; Fearon , at paras. 69 -73; R. v.

(3d) 350, at para. 43).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n \n [114]  The standard of reasonable and probable grounds requires the Crown to \nestablish the reasonable probability of the claimed exigency, based on the experience \nand expertise of the police and the relevant facts  before them; it does not require the \nCrown to establish the exigency on the balance of probabilities (see R. v. Beaver , 2022 \nSCC 54, at para. 72, discussing the standard of reasonable and probable grounds for a \nwarrantless arrest).

Beaver , 2022 \nSCC 54, at para. 72, discussing the standard of reasonable and probable grounds for a \nwarrantless arrest). The Crown must show tha t the officers’ reasonable belief in the \nexigency was “objectively grounded in the circumstances of the case” ( R. v. Pawar , \n2020 BCCA 251, 393 C.C.C. (3d) 408,  at para. 73; see also para. 79; Beaver , at para. \n72; Hobeika , at para. 45). The subjective views  of the police must have been objectively \nreasonable ( Beaver , at para. 72; R. v. McCormack , 2000 BCCA 57, 133 B.C.A.C. 44, \nat para. 25). A vague, speculative, or general concern that delaying a search to obtain a \nwarrant would risk the loss of evidence doe s not meet the exigency threshold ( Pawar , \nat para. 72).  \n(iv) The Standard of Appellate Review  \n[115]  A trial judge’s assessment of the evidence and findings of fact in applying \ns. 11(7) attract “substantial deference” on appeal (see R. v. Cornell , 2010 SCC 31, \n[2010] 2 S.C.R. 142, at para. 25; Hobeika , at para. 45). But whether the facts as found \nby the trial judge meet the legal standard for exigency under s. 11(7) is a question of \nlaw reviewable for correctness ( R. v. Shepherd , 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at \npara. 20; R. v. Dussault , 2022 SCC 16, [2022] 1 S.C.R. 306, at para. 26; R. v. Chehil , \n2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at para. 60). As this Court has emphasized, \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n \n “[w]hether there existed reasonable grounds for concern about safety or destruction of \neviden ce must not be viewed ‘through the “lens of hindsight”’” ( Cornell , at para. 23, \nquoting Crampton v. Walton , 2005 ABCA 81, 40 Alta. L.R. (4th) 28, at para. 45). \nCourts should not second -guess reasonable operational decisions taken by the police \n(Hobeika , at para. 52, citing Cornell , at paras. 24 and 36).  \n(b) Application  \n[116]  As the Court of Appeal noted, “[t]he trial judge thoroughly reviewed the \nevidence” regarding the exigent circumstances and impracticability of obtaining a \nwarrant, as required by s. 11(7) of the CDSA  (para. 76). Applying this Court’s decision \nin Paterson , the trial judge concluded:  \n. . . I find that there were exigent circumstances in this case. Without \nimmediate action, the transaction and the drugs were at risk. The texts show \nthat “Dew” was alr eady impatient. At that time of day, only a telewarrant \nwould have been available, but in any event it would likely arrive too late \nto complete this transaction. The likelihood that the transaction involved \nfentanyl and its dramatic effects on the communit y makes this a matter of \npublic safety.  \n \n(voir dire reasons, at para. 100)  \n[117]  Like the Court of Appeal, I see no error in the trial judge’s analysis. The \ntrial judge made specific findings relating to the need for immediate police action to \nprotect public safety and the impracticability of obtaining a warrant, which \ncumulatively met the legal standard under s. 11(7). I will address each finding in turn.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n \n (i) The Situation Involved a Suspected Drug Sale Calling for Immediate \nPolice Action  \n[118]  The trial judge accepted  that the police officers reasonably believed that \nthey faced an urgent situation involving a suspected drug sale calling for immediate \npolice action.

The texts show that ‘Dew’ was already \nimpatient” ( voir dire reasons, at para.  100).  \n[119]  The trial judge’s findings were supported by the officers’ evidence at the \nvoir dire . For example, Officer Orok testified that, based on the first four texts from \nDew and his experience in investigating drug transactions, the situation was urgent. \nOfficer Orok highlighted that Dew had texted that he did not want to drive around with \nthe drugs, and that once he learned that Mr. Gammie had been arrested, he would not \ncontact Mr.  Gammie or bring the drugs to Guelph to sell them to him:  \nQ. There’s nothing of urgency in the text message.  \n \nA. Other than the person said they don’t want to drive around with it, that \nwould be an urgency.   \n \nQ. Okay, but that could mean that that person is going to drive around with \nit for a month, two weeks, right?  \n \nA.

He testified tha t Dew’s texts suggested that he was \nimpatient and did not want to drive around with the drugs, and that if Mr. Gammie took \ntoo long to respond, Dew would sell the drugs elsewhere in the community, since \ntraffickers “don’t just traffic to one person” (A.R. , part V , vol. I, at p. 59). He explained \nthat it was “likely that Dew didn’t just traffic to Gammie”, and that like most drug \ntraffickers, Dew “likely trafficked to other people” (p. 96). In his view, Dew was “likely \nto traffic this drug either to Gammie, or if not Gammie it’d be to somebody else, and \nthat that would cause death in our community ” (p. 96).  \n[121]  Based on this evidence, I see no basis to impugn the trial judge’s finding \nthat the situation required immediate police action because it involved an imp atient \ndrug dealer who expected to sell his drugs imminently, either to Mr. Gammie or to \nsomebody else. The police had interrupted Dew’s planned sale to Mr. Gammie and \nwere faced with Dew’s expressed impatience and desire not to drive around with the \ndrugs . Had the police not acted immediately, the drugs would have been trafficked \nelsewhere in the community imminently.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n \n [122]  Nor do I accept Mr. Campbell’s argument that the Court of Appeal \nreviewed the trial judge’s reasons under the wrong legal standard for exige ncy under s. \n11(7). The Court of Appeal said that had the police not intercepted this transaction, \n“[t]he drugs would have been outside the reach of the police and sold to someone else \nat another time, ultimately reaching users on the street ” (para. 83 (em phasis added)). \nMr. Campbell submits that the words “at another time” and “ultimately” fall short of \nthe high standard outlined in Paterson , under which the exigent circumstances must \ncall for “immediate police action” (para.  33) to prevent an “im",

    "text": "[t]he drugs would have been outside the reach of the police and sold to someone else \nat another time, ultimately reaching users on the street ” (para. 83 (em phasis added)). \nMr. Campbell submits that the words “at another time” and “ultimately” fall short of \nthe high standard outlined in Paterson , under which the exigent circumstances must \ncall for “immediate police action” (para.  33) to prevent an “imminent da nger” (para. \n32, quoting Grant , at p.  243).  \n[123]  I agree that, read in isolation, the words “at another time” and “ultimately” \ndo not correctly express the legal threshold for exigency contemplated in Paterson . \nNevertheless, the Court of Appeal proceeded to app ly the correct legal standard, which \nasks whether the circumstances called for immediate police action. In the very next \nparagraph, the Court of Appeal accepted that “the trial judge found that immediate  \naction was required” (para. 84 (emphasis in original )). The trial judge himself had \napplied the exigency standard from Paterson  and concluded that “[w]ithout immediate  \naction, the transaction and the drugs  were at risk” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 100 \n(emphasis added)). I therefore see no error in how the Court of Appeal applied the \nexigency standard articulated in Paterson . \n[124]  Here, the police needed to act immediately to intercept the sale of these \ndrugs to prevent them from being trafficked in the community imminently. The Crown \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n \n did not have to establish th at the police had evidence that Dew had another specific sale \nlined up if the sale to Mr. Gammie fell through.  \n[125]  Finally, I accept that the police cannot devise an investigative strategy to \ncreate circumstances of exigency in order to proceed without a warrant. In some cases, \n“[i]f the police strategy creates the supposed urgency, the circumstances are not \n‘exigent’, but are anticipated, if not planned for, by the police” ( Hobeika , at para. 49, \nper Doherty J.A., citing R. v. Silveira , [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297 , at paras. 49 -53 and 84 -86, \nper La Forest J., dissenting, and R. v. Phoummasak , 2016 ONCA 46, 350 C.R.R. (2d) \n370, at paras. 15 -18). In this case, however, after Dew’s first four text messages, the \npolice “were faced with an active, unfolding crime” ( R. v. Webster , 2015 BCCA 286, \n374 B.C.A.C. 129, at para. 90; see also R. v. Hunter , 2015 BCCA 428, 378 B.C.A.C. \n165, at para. 30). As a result, the police responded to, but did not create, the situation \nof exigency.  \n(ii) The Police Suspected the Drugs Were Heroin L aced With Fentanyl, Which \nPosed a Grave Risk to Public Safety  \n[126]  The trial judge found that “all of the evidence supports a finding that the \nofficers thought that they were dealing with a transaction related to heroin, likely laced \nwith fentanyl” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 92). He stated that “[t]he three officers that \nsaw [Dew’s four] texts and spoke about them always considered the product in question \nto be heroin and fentanyl. Their credibility was not attacked in cross -examination. \nThere is no reason to reject their evidence” (para. 93). He found that the police believed \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n \n there was a “likelihood that the transaction involved fentanyl”, which given “its \ndramatic effects on the community ma[de] this a matter of public safety” (para. 100).  \n[127]  The trial judge’s f inding that Dew’s first four texts, referring to “1250 for \nthis half”, likely involved heroin laced with fentanyl was supported by the evidence. \nSergeant Bair reasonably inferred that the phrase “1250 for this half” was consistent \nwith a cheap price for he roin. He testified that half an ounce of heroin was selling for \nabout $1,400, while cocaine was selling for $1,800 an ounce and crystal \nmethamphetamine was selling for between $600",

    "text": " that Dew’s first four texts, referring to “1250 for \nthis half”, likely involved heroin laced with fentanyl was supported by the evidence. \nSergeant Bair reasonably inferred that the phrase “1250 for this half” was consistent \nwith a cheap price for he roin. He testified that half an ounce of heroin was selling for \nabout $1,400, while cocaine was selling for $1,800 an ounce and crystal \nmethamphetamine was selling for between $600 and $900 an ounce ( voir dire reasons, \nat para. 54). He also knew that, base d on his experience, 75 percent of the heroin seized \nby police in the Guelph area in 2017 was laced with fentanyl. In addition, two \nconfidential informers had advised the police that Mr. Gammie was selling heroin or \nperhaps heroin and fentanyl. As a result , Sergeant Bair reasonably believed that it was \n“highly likely” this was a transaction for heroin laced with fentanyl (A.R. , part V , vol. \nI, at p. 20).  \n[128]  Similarly, Officer Hunt testified that two reliable confidential informers \nhad advised him that Mr. Gamm ie was trafficking in cocaine, heroin, and crystal \nmethamphetamine, and that one confidential informer had included fentanyl on the list. \nOfficer Orok testified that, based on the confidential informer information, he believed \nthat Mr. Gammie was dealing i n heroin.  \n[129]  I see no merit in Mr. Campbell’s argument that the trial judge made \n“questionable” inferences by finding that the police had reasonable and probable \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n \n grounds to believe the transaction involved heroin laced with fentanyl (A.F., at para. \n47). Mr. C ampbell says that the police “did not know who ‘Dew’ was, or anything \nabout him as a drug trafficker”, and “had no way of knowing if this heroin contained \nfentanyl and, if so, how much” (para. 47 (emphasis deleted)). This argument would \nerroneously require  the police to establish a certainty that the drugs involved fentanyl, \nrather than reasonable and probable grounds. In my view, the police had such grounds.  \n[130]  I therefore see no basis to impugn the trial judge’s finding that “[o]n this \nevidence, .  . . the o fficers believed that the drug transaction was for heroin laced with \nfentanyl” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 96).  \n[131]  Equally unassailable is the trial judge’s finding that the officers reasonably \nbelieved that this drug transaction raised a need to protect pub lic safety because of \n“[t]he likelihood that the transaction involved fentanyl and its dramatic effects on the \ncommunity” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 100). Sergeant Bair highlighted the devastation \nwrought by fentanyl in Ontario, and more specifically, in  Guelph. In 2017, more people \ndied in Ontario from fentanyl overdoses than from car crashes. Guelph also had higher \nrates of death and hospitalization from opioid overdoses than the provincial average, \nwith 65 percent of opioid deaths in Guelph being fenta nyl-related. The Guelph police \ntook a particular interest in fentanyl investigations to “save people’s lives” (A.R. , part \nV, vol. I, at p. 11).  \n[132]  The severe dangers posed by fentanyl trafficking were highlighted by \nMoldaver J. in R. v. Parranto , 2021 SCC 46,  [2021] 3 S.C.R. 366, at paras. 94 -97, but \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n \n bear repeating. Fentanyl is a highly addictive and extremely powerful opioid pain \nreliever and sedative intended to be administered in medical settings. It is estimated to \nbe up to 100 times more potent than morph ine and about 25 to 50 times more potent \nthan heroin. A lethal dose can be less than two milligrams, or about the size of a single \ngrain of salt. Fentanyl is also much cheaper than other drugs, and so drug dealers will \noften mix small amounts of it with ot her drugs to create a cheaper product with similar \neffects, thus significantly increasing their profits.

    "text": ", or about the size of a single \ngrain of salt. Fentanyl is also much cheaper than other drugs, and so drug dealers will \noften mix small amounts of it with ot her drugs to create a cheaper product with similar \neffects, thus significantly increasing their profits. Because fentanyl is visually \nindistinguishable from other hard drugs, it exposes vulnerable drug users to the risk of \nserious harm, including brain dam age, organ damage, coma, and death. Over the past \ndecade, fentanyl -related deaths have increased dramatically across Canada, leading to \nwhat various courts have described as a “national crisis” (para. 96). As Moldaver J. \nwarned, “[a]s grave a threat as dru gs such as heroin and cocaine pose, that threat pales \nin comparison to the one posed by fentanyl and its analogues. .  . . [F]entanyl has altered \nthe landscape of the substance abuse crisis in Canada, revealing itself as public enemy \nnumber one” (para. 93).  \n[133]  Although Mr. Campbell does not dispute the dangers of fentanyl, he \nadvances two objections to the conclusion that exigent circumstances existed.  \n[134]  First, Mr. Campbell says that the Court of Appeal reviewed the trial judge’s \nconclusion on exigency under a s tandard of reasonableness rather than correctness. He \nimpugns the Court of Appeal’s statement that “[a]lthough the trial judge’s conclusion \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n \n relied on some contingencies, it was not unduly speculative, nor was it unreasonable ” \n(para. 83 (emphasis added)).  \n[135]  I would not give effect to this submission. The Court of Appeal’s focus in \nthe impugned paragraph was whether the evidence before the trial judge provided a \nbasis for him to find, as a fact, that the police acted to protect public safety. The court \nconclud ed that the trial judge’s finding was one “that was available to him on the \nevidence” (para. 83). Although the use of the word “unreasonable” may not have \nconveyed that the applicable standard of review was palpable and overriding error, I \nsee no basis for  appellate intervention. Because the trial judge’s conclusion was neither \nunduly speculative nor unreasonable, it was not a palpable and overriding error.  \n[136]  Second, Mr. Campbell asserts that the reasoning of the trial judge \neffectively creates a “fentanyl ex ception” to the standard for exigency that would be \nmet in every case of suspected trafficking of serious drugs. He claims that a finding of \nexigent circumstances must be extraordinary, and that “if the standard for exigent \ncircumstances applied in the pre sent case were to be validated, the police would never \nneed a warrant in any case involving a serious drug” (A.F., at para. 48).  \n[137]  I accept that, “[b]y their nature, exigent circumstances are extraordinary \nand should be invoked to justify violation of a per son’s privacy only [when] necessary” \n(R. v. Kelsy , 2011 ONCA 605, 280 C.C.C. (3d) 456, at para. 35, per Rosenberg J.A., \nreferring to R. v. Feeney , [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para.  52). At the same time, I do not \nshare Mr. Campbell’s fear that the suspected presence of fentanyl alone will amount to \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n \n exigent circumstances in every case. The trial judge’s finding of exigency was based \non both the reasonabl y suspected presence of fentanyl and the need for the police to act \nimmediately given the impatience that Dew had expressed in his text messages. In all \nthe circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the police were \nreasonably justified i n seeing this as a now -or-never situation requiring them to act \nimmediately to protect public safety.  \n[138]  Different facts might have yielded a different conclusion. For example, had \nDew texted to set up a drug transaction the next day or week, the same urgenc y might \nnot have been present. Depending on the circumstances, the police may have been able, \nand required, to obtain a warrant. But that is not what happened here. Had the police \nnot intervened immediately, the deadly drugs Mr. Campbell was trafficking wo uld have \nbeen out of their reach and would have been trafficked to vulnerable drug users in the \ncommunity imminently",

Had the police \nnot intervened immediately, the deadly drugs Mr. Campbell was trafficking wo uld have \nbeen out of their reach and would have been trafficked to vulnerable drug users in the \ncommunity imminently.  \n[139]  In my view, therefore, the trial judge correctly found that the legal standard \nfor exigent circumstances was met because the police faced an urgent situation calling \nfor immediate police action to protect public safety.  \n(iii) The Circumstances for Obtaining a Warrant Existed but It Was \nImpracticable To Obtain One  \n[140]  Mr. Campbell does not seriously dispute that the police had grounds to \nobtain a warra nt. Based on the first four texts from Dew that the police saw on \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n \n Mr. Gammie’s phone, the police had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that \nDew intended to traffic heroin laced with fentanyl to Mr. Gammie. Mr. Campbell also \nconceded that it was im practicable for the police to obtain a warrant in the \ncircumstances (transcript, at p. 7). As the trial judge found, late in the afternoon on June \n14, 2017, “only a telewarrant would have been available, but in any event it would \nlikely arrive too late to complete this transaction” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 100). I see \nno basis to intervene with these findings.  \n(c) Conclusion  \n[141]  I conclude that the trial judge did not err in holding that the police had \nauthority for a warrantless search under s. 11(7) of the CDSA. As a result, the police \ndid not infringe s. 8 of the Charter . \n(4) This Court Should Decline To Entertain Mr. Campbell’s New Argument \nThat Section 11(7) of the CDSA  Does Not Apply to the Search of a Text \nMessage Conversation  \n[142]  At the oral argument of this app eal, counsel for Mr. Campbell briefly raised \na new argument that had not been raised in the courts below or in the written arguments \nbefore this Court. He argued that s. 11(7) of the CDSA  only authorizes the search of a \n“place”, which he said did not exten d to the search of Mr. Campbell’s text message \nconversation. He asserted that the search in this case could only have been authorized \nby a general warrant issued under s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code , which does not \nauthorize a warrantless search under exig ent circumstances (transcript, at pp. 20 and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n \n 131-32). Counsel for the Crown responded that had a general warrant been required, \nthe search would have been justified under the common law doctrine of exigent \ncircumstances (pp. 105 -6).  \n[143]  In my view, this Court  should decline to entertain this new argument raised \nfor the first time during oral argument before this Court. As this Court has repeatedly \naffirmed, appellate courts are generally reluctant to entertain new arguments when \n“they are deprived of the trial  court’s perspective” ( R. v. J.F. , 2022 SCC 17, [2022] 1 \nS.C.R. 330, at para.  40). Parties can raise new arguments on appeal only in exceptional \ncircumstances, having regard to, among other things, “the state of the record, fairness \nto all parties, the imp ortance of having the issue resolved by th[e] [c]ourt, its suitability \nfor decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice” (para. 41, quoting \nGuindon v. Canada , 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 20; see also Ontario \n(Attorney Ge neral) v. Restoule , 2024 SCC 27, at para. 204).  \n[144]  Here, Mr. Campbell’s new argument was not raised in the courts below or \nin his written submissions before this Court.

It Is Not Necessary To Address Section 24(2) of the Charter  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n \n [145]  Because I conclude that the police did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter , it is \nnot necessary to address whether the evidence should have been excluded under s. \n24(2) of the Charter . \nVI. Disposition  \n[146]  I would dismiss the appeal.  \n The following are the reasons delivered by  \n ROWE J. —  \n[147]  I agree fully with my colleague, Justice Jamal, i n his reasons and in the \nresult. I write separately only in response to the treatment of exigent circumstances and \nthe analysis under s.  24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  by my \ncolleagues, Justice  Martin and Justice Moreau, in their diss enting reasons.  \nI. Paterson Is the Governing Case on “Exigent Circumstances”  \n[148]  As Justice Jamal sets out, s. 11(7) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances \nAct, S.C. 1996, c.  19 (“ CDSA ”), authorizes peace officers to conduct a warrantless \nsearch if the conditions  for a warrant exist, but “exigent circumstances” render it \n“impracticable” to obtain one (para. 111).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n \n [149]  R. v. Paterson , 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, is the governing \nprecedent on exigent circumstances under s. 11(7). My colleagues, in their dissenting  \nreasons, trace the development of the doctrine of exigent circumstances in the pre - and \npost-Charter era. They characterize Paterson as a summary of the existing \njurisprudence, and state that the case did not set out “a new test or alte[r] the standards \nrequired to establish exigency in established categories” (para. 310). My colleagues \nrely on paras. 32 -33 in Paterson  to support this view (para. 310).  \n[150]  Respectfully, this does not give proper effect to Paterson . Rather, it has the \neffect of Paterson being r eplaced by my colleagues’ preferred formulation of the law. \nThis is problematic methodologically. Let us assume that I prefer jurisprudence that \npreceded the References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act , 2021 SCC 11, \n[2021] 1 S.C.R. 175 (“ GHG Referen ces”). Applying the methodology used by my \ncolleagues, I could sidestep the precedent that I do not prefer by saying, “The GHG \nReferences  simply applied R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd. , [1988] 1 S.C.R. 401. \nTherefore, I will rely on Crown Zellerbach  as the guiding jurisprudence and not the \nGHG References .” Such an approach would undermine precedent and invite sophistry \nin legal argument.  \n[151]  While Justice Brown in Paterson  referred to cases on exigency in his \ninterpretation of s. 11(7) of the CDSA , as one wo uld expect, he went on to set out a \nframework for exigent circumstances that continues to govern (paras. 32 -33 and 37).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n \n [152]  The two paragraphs in Paterson which my colleagues have identified — \nparas. 32 -33 — need to be read in the context of the decision as a  whole. When this is \ndone, it is clear that the Court in Paterson  had two objectives: (1) to respond to an \nargument raised by the appellant about the relationship between s. 11(7) of the CDSA",

When this is \ndone, it is clear that the Court in Paterson  had two objectives: (1) to respond to an \nargument raised by the appellant about the relationship between s. 11(7) of the CDSA \nand s. 529.3(2) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.  C-46 (paras. 29 -31); and (2) to \nset out a “common theme” of “urgency” for exigent circumstances under s. 11(7) (para. \n33 (emphasis deleted)).  \n[153]  As to the first objective, the appellant in Paterson urged the Court to import \nthe definition o f “exigent circumstances” at s.  529.3(2) of the Criminal Code  into \ns. 11(7) of the CDSA (para. 30). This submission was rejected (para. 31).  \n[154]  At paragraph 32, Justice Brown acknowledged that the circumstances in \nwhich exigent circumstances have been recogni zed bore “close resemblance” to the \ndefinitional categories in s. 529.3(2). It was in this context that he proceeded to review \nthe existing case law:  \nAll that said, circumstances in which “exigent circumstances” have been \nrecognized have borne close resemb lance to the definitional categories in \ns. 529.3(2).  This Court’s jurisprudence considering s. 10 of the Narcotic \nControl Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. N -1 (which was repealed and replaced by the \nCDSA ), which permitted a peace officer to search a place that was not  a \ndwelling -house without a warrant so long as he or she believed on \nreasonable grounds that a narcotic offence had been committed, is \ninstructive. That provision was held in R. v. Grant , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223 \n(“Grant  1993”), to be consistent with s. 8 of th e Charter  if it were read \ndown to permit warrantless searches only where there were exigent \ncircumstances. Such exigent circumstances were then described to exist \nwhere there is an “imminent danger of the loss, removal, destruction or \ndisappearance of the evidence if the search or seizure is delayed” ( Grant \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n \n 1993, at p. 243; R. v. Feeney , [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 153, per \nL’Heureux -Dubé J., dissenting; and R. v. Silveira , [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297, at \npara. 51, per La Forest J., dissenting). Similarly, circums tances in which \n“immediate action is required for the safety of the police” were also found \nto qualify as “exigent” ( Feeney , at para. 52; see also, in respect of searches \nto preserve officer safety, this Court’s statement in R. v. MacDonald , 2014 \nSCC 3, [2 014] 1 S.C.R. 37, at para. 32, that such searches will be \nresponsive to “dangerous situations created by individuals, to which the \npolice must react ‘on the sudden’”). In Feeney , at para. 47, exigency was \nalso said to possibly arise when police officers ar e in “hot pursuit” of a \nsuspect (see also R. v. Macooh , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 802, at pp. 820 -21). \n[Emphasis added; para.  32.] \n[155]  Turning to the second objective, Justice Brown’s review of the \njurisprudence led him to set out a  “common theme” of “urgency” (para.  33):  \nThe common theme emerging from these descriptions of “exigent \ncircumstances” in s. 11(7) denotes not merely convenience, propitiousness \nor economy, but rather  urgency , arising from circumstances calling for \nimmediate police action to preserve evidence,  officer safety or public \nsafety.

    "text": " to set out a  “common theme” of “urgency” (para.  33):  \nThe common theme emerging from these descriptions of “exigent \ncircumstances” in s. 11(7) denotes not merely convenience, propitiousness \nor economy, but rather  urgency , arising from circumstances calling for \nimmediate police action to preserve evidence,  officer safety or public \nsafety. This threshold is affirmed by the French version of s. 11(7), which \nreads “ l’urgence de la situation ”. \n[156]  Justice Brown then set out a concise statement of the law on exigent \ncircumstances under s. 11(7) of the CDSA  (para. 37 ): \nIn sum, I conclude that, in order for a warrantless entry to satisfy \ns. 11(7), the Crown must show that the entry was compelled by urgency, \ncalling for immediate police action to preserve evidence, officer safety or \npublic safety.  Further, this urgency must be shown to have been such  that \ntaking the time to obtain a warrant would pose serious risk to those \nimperatives.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n \n [157]  Paterson is not merely a summary of the cases that came before. Rather, it \nsets out a definitive statement of the doctrine of exigent circumstances, which statement \ncontinues to govern.  \n[158]  My colleagues seek to go behind Paterson  and rely on earlier cases in order \nto advance their own view of “a narrow and strict application of the safety branch, or \nindeed any category of exigent circumstances” (para. 318). While I agree that earlier \ncase law can provide a degree of insight into exigent circumstances (e.g., what \nconst itutes a risk to officer safety), it is not a basis to sidestep the law as stated in \nPaterson .  \nII. There Was “Imminent” Risk of Harm to Public Safety  \n[159]  Under Paterson , one way “urgency” can arise is when “immediate police \naction” is needed to preserve public sa fety (paras. 33 and 37).  \n[160]  My colleagues, in their dissenting reasons, suggest that a “safety risk” to \nthe public must be “imminent” (para. 319), but found that it was not so here as two \nevents were needed for the risk to public safety to materialize: first,  Mr. Campbell \nwould need to sell the drugs to a street dealer; then, the street dealer would need to sell \nthe drugs to those who would consume them (para. 321).  \n[161]  Respectfully, this comports with neither the jurisprudence nor the trial \njudge’s findings. The harm to the public was “imminent” as there was a narrow window \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n \n of opportunity  for police to prevent what they reasonably believed was the sale by Dew \nof a significant quantity of drugs containing fentanyl ( voir dire  reasons (reproduced in \nA.R., at pp.  1-36), at paras. 96 and 100). If the police failed to prevent this sale, they \nbelieved it could well lead to deaths in the community. As Justice Jamal describes it, \nthe police were faced with a “now -or-never” situation (para. 137).  \n[162]  This was a dynamic and time -sensitive situation. First, Dew’s texts \ndisplayed impatience about the sale ( voir dire  reasons, at para. 100), and the police \nbelieved if they took too long to reply, they would lose contact as Dew would assume \nMr. Gammie was arrested (A.R., part  V, vol. I , at pp. 59 and 241 -42). Second, Sergeant \nBair testified that he did not know who Dew was, and he was in no position to find \nDew otherwise (p. 96). Third, multiple officers testified that they believed if this deal \nwas not completed, the drugs would be tra fficked elsewhere in the community (pp. 59, \n96, 182 -83 and 241 -42). Finally, the police were aware of the potentially fatal \nconsequences of fentanyl in their jurisdiction, thereby making this a matter of public \nsafety ( voir dire  reasons, at para. 100).  \n[163]  My colleagues implicitly elevate the evidentiary requirements for exigent \ncircumstances. They state there was nothing in the record to suggest that there was \n“another prospective buyer immediately waiting in",

They state there was nothing in the record to suggest that there was \n“another prospective buyer immediately waiting in the wings, making the potential sale \nimminent” (pa ra. 327). Respectfully, the Crown did not have to establish that Dew had \nanother transaction lined up if the transaction with Mr.  Gammie fell through. As Justice \nJamal correctly states, the standard for establishing exigent circumstances is \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n \n “reasonable and  probable grounds” (para. 113). The trial judge found that this was met; \nhis findings are supported by the record.  \n[164]  The facts in this case come within “exigent circumstances” under s. 11(7) \nas described in Paterson . There is no basis to disturb the trial j udge’s conclusion that, \n“[w]ithout immediate action, the transaction and the drugs were at risk” ( voir dire  \nreasons, at para. 100). The police had a limited window of opportunity to apprehend \nMr. Campbell. Waiting for a telewarrant would have seriously undermined the police’s \nobjective to protect the public (A.R., part  V, vol.  I, at pp. 59, 95 -96 and 183).  \n[165]  One can readily contemplate comparable circumstances of a \n“now -or-never” situation in which police have a very limited opportunity to prevent a \nthreat to public safety, e.g. to thwart the transfer of arms or explosives intended for use \nin a politically -motiva ted attack in a public place on a later significant date, like July \n1. \nIII. Section 24(2) Analysis  \n[166]  On the issue of s. 24(2) of the Charter , I agree with Justice Côté in her \nconcurring reasons. I would add only t he following.  \n[167]  In relation to the first  factor  in R. v. Grant , 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. \n353, my colleagues, in their dissenting reasons, are of the view that none of the police \nofficers attempted “to obtain judicial authorization in the approximately  two-hour \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n \n timeframe during which they communicated wi th Mr. Campbell” (para. 342). \nHowever, this overlooks the finding by the trial judge that the police engaged in a \ndiscussion about what they should do before texting Mr.  Campbell ( voir dire  reasons, \nat paras.  68, 72 -73 and 132). This finding is supported b y the evidence, as multiple \npolice officers testified that they actively turned their mind to the question of judicial \nauthorization  before concluding that they had no time to obtain a warrant (A.R., part  V, \nvol. I, at pp.  95-96, 125 -26, 179 -80 and 242 -43). Further, while we now know that the \ncommunications between the police and Mr. Campbell extended over two hours, the \npolice had no way to know this at the time. In a volatile and uncertain situation, minutes \ncould well have made the difference between int ercepting the fentanyl or having the \nopportunity to do so slip through their fingers.  \n The following are the reasons delivered by  \n CÔTÉ J. —  \nI. Introduction  \n[168]  I agree with my colleague Jamal  J. that the appeal should be dismissed. \nHowever, I would arrive at my  conclusion for reasons more closely aligned with those \nof the trial judge. In my opinion, the police conduct did not amount to a search for the \npurposes of s.  8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Indeed, not all \nundercover police investigatio ns result in a search or seizure within the meaning of s.  8 \nof the Charter . \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n \n [169]  While I would find that the appellant, Mr.  Campbell, had a subjective \nexpectation of privacy in the subject matter at issue, his expectation of privacy was not \nobjectively reasonab le in the totality of the circumstances of this case.

It is quite clear \nthat our Court’s decision in R. v. Marakah , 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, did not \ncreate a categorical rule that all text messages or other electronic communications \ninherently att ract a reasonable expectation of privacy. The “totality of the \ncircumstances” test, which was endorsed in Marakah  and in other cases involving s.  8, \nmandates an individualized and case -by-case analysis, requiring a court to treat an \nassessment under s.  8 as a “contextual, fact -based inquiry” ( R. v. McNeil , 2009 SCC 3, \n[2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para.  12). \n[170]  Assessed in the totality of the circumstances of this case, any subjective \nexpectation of privacy that the appellant may have possessed was significantly \ndiminished and did not attract s.  8 protection. The police were at liberty to view and \nrespond to the four text messages they passively received and observed on \nMr. Gammie’s lawfully seized phone. Indeed, the police were conducting an \nundercover investigation into criminal activity directly associated with the purpose \nunderlying the arrest of Mr.  Gammie  — a drug transaction. As our Court has \nrecognized, “[i]t is antithetical to our system of justice to proceed on the basis that the \npolice, and other authorities , should only search for evidence which incriminates their \nchosen suspect” ( CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General) , [1999] \n1 S.C.R. 743, at para.  24). \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n \n [171]  Beyond the undercover nature of the investigation, there are multiple \nfactors that suppo rt the Crown’s submission that the appellant’s subjective expectation \nof privacy was not objectively reasonable. These factors include, but are not limited to, \nthe circumscribed nature and lack of intrusiveness of the police conduct, the ownership \nof and c ontrol over the device and the electronic communications therein, and the \ndistinction between the circumstances of the present case and those existing in \nMarakah . Like the trial judge held on the voir dire , I am also of the opinion that the \nelectronic communications did not reveal any information that implicated the \nbiographical core of the appellant, nor were they likely, based on the normative nature \nof the s.  8 inquiry, to reveal any, given the circumscribed nature of the police \ninvestigation.  \n[172]  This i s the basis on which I reach the same outcome as my colleague \nJustice  Jamal and dismiss the appeal.  \nII. Analysis  \nA. Searches for the Purposes of Section 8  \n[173]  It is well established that the determination of whether the police have \nconducted a search for the purposes of s.  8 of the Charter  directly hinges on the \npresence of a reasonable expectation of privacy within the specific circumstances of \nthe case. It is essential for courts, when conducting this assessment, to balance \n“sometimes conflicting interests in the privacy necessary for personal dignity and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n \n autonomy and the need for a secure and safe society” ( R. v. Mills , 2019 SCC 22, [2019] \n2 S.C.R. 320, at par a. 38, per Karakatsanis  J., concurring). The assessment involves a \ncareful equilibrium “between privacy and law enforcement interests” ( Marakah , at \npara.  100, per Moldaver  J., dissenting, but not on this point; see also R. v. Hafizi , 2023 \nONCA 639, 168 O.R . (3d) 435, at para.  115).  \n[174]  Not every government examination or investigatory technique will \nconstitute a search under the Charter  (Mills , at para.  41, per Karakatsanis  J.; see also \nR",

Evans , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, at para.  11; R. v. Tessling , 2004 SCC 67, [ 2004] 3 S.C.R. \n432, at para.  18; R. v. Cole , 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para.  34). In the \ncontext of s.  8, a search “is the examination by state officials of matters over which the \nperson enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy” (N.  Hasan et al ., Search and Seizure  \n(2021), at p.  2). As our Court confirmed in Tessling , “[i]t is only ‘[i]f the police activity \ninvades a reasonable expectation of privacy [that] the activity is a search’” (para.  18, \nciting R. v. Wise , [1992] 1 S.C.R. 527, at p.  533).  An inspection is therefore only \ndeemed a search “where a person has a reasonable privacy interest in the object or \nsubject matter of the state action and the information to which it gives access” ( Cole , \nat para.  34). \n[175]  For claimants to benefit from this s.  8 protection against unreasonable state \nconduct, they must establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the subject matter \nof the “putative” search (see Mills , at para.  12, citing Marakah , at para.  10). More \nspecifically, they must have a subjective ex pectation of privacy, and their subjective \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n \n expectation must be objectively reasonable. Courts must make this assessment having \nregard to “the totality of the circumstances” of a given case. The assessment proceeds \nwith the following four lines of inquiry:  \n1. What was the subject matter of the alleged search?  \n \n2. Did the claimant have a direct interest in the subject matter?  \n \n3. Did the claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject \nmatter?  \n \n4. If so, was the claimant’s subjective expectation of privac y objectively \nreasonable?  \n \n(Marakah , at para.  11) \n[176]  Whether one’s subjective expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable \nwill “vary with the nature of the matter sought to be protected, the circumstances in \nwhich and the place where state intrusion occu rs, and the purposes of the intrusion” \n(R. v. Patrick , 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para.  38, citing R. v. Colarusso , \n[1994] 1 S.C.R. 20, at p.  53). Indeed, there is no “definitive list of factors that must be \nconsidered in answering this question”  (Cole , at para.  45). Since factual circumstances \ndiffer between cases, such variation requires courts to place emphasis on different \nfactors depending on the circumstances of a case ( R. v. Edwards , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, \nat para.  45; R. v. Jones , 2017 SCC 6 0, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 696, at para.  13). Some examples \ninclude the place where the search occurred (see Tessling ; Patrick ); control over the \nsubject matter (see Marakah ; Cole ; R. v.

Electronic Communications and Section 8  \n[177]  The appellant suggests that the factual circumstances at issue in the present \ncase are identical to those that our Court observed in Marakah . He submits tha t the \nfacts of the two cases display “no legally significant differences” (A.F., at para.  28). I \nrespectfully disagree and believe it is important to explain my reasoning to properly \nsituate these reasons within our Court’s jurisprudence.  \n[178]  I do not question  the idea that Marakah  represented a groundbreaking \ndevelopment in our s.  8 jurisprudence and supported the fact that electronic \ncommunications may contain private content (see Marakah , at para.  36, per \nMcLachlin  C.J., and at para.  92, per Moldaver  J.; R. v. J.J. , 2022 SCC 28, at para.  238, \nper Brown  J., dissenting in part). The majority’s decision in that case has undoubtedly \nhad a profound impact on judicial decision -making across Canada for both trial and \nappellate courts. Indeed, it has served as a cata lyst and has paved the way for \nstrengthened legal protections under the Charter , allowing some senders of text \nmessages to maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their electronic \ncommunications.  \n[179]  But that is not always the case. It must be remember ed that Marakah  did \nnot set out a categorical proposition that all senders of text messages retain a reasonable \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n \n expectation of privacy over their electronic communications, nor did it suggest that all \ntext message conversations would attract such a reasona ble expectation. The Crown in \nthis case asserts that Marakah  “did not create a rule of automatic standing for all \ncommunications in written electronic form” (R.F., at para.  3). I cannot agree more. \nIndeed, the Court of Appeal for Ontario recently proceeded  on the same understanding \nin R. v. Knelsen , 2024 ONCA 501, at para.  38, where van  Rensburg  J.A. wrote that \n“[t]here is no automatic standing to assert a s.  8 right in respect of text messages that \nhave been sent and received” (emphasis deleted). It is imperative to provide this \nclarification given  the evolving jurisprudence referenced by the Crown, which \nseemingly equates a private communication with inherent standing under s.  8 in any \ncontext (R.F., at para.  34; see also R. v. Rafferty , 2018 ONCJ 881, 424 C.R.R. (2d) 88, \nat para.  23; R. v. Devic , 2018 BCPC 318, at paras.  29-31; R. v. Bear -Knight , 2021 \nSKQB 258, [2022] 2 W.W.R. 537, at paras.  18-31; R. v. Findlay , 2023 MBPC 17, 529 \nC.R.R. (2d) 284, at paras.  7-9). \n[180]  Writing for the majority in Marakah , McLachlin  C.J. expressly rejected the \nproposition  that text message communications would always  attract a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy. She underscored that this notion would not invariably hold true \nin every case, and explained that “depending on the totality of the circumstances”, text \nmessage con versations “may in some cases” attract protection for the sender under s.  8 \n(para.  4). She clarified this point at para.  5: \nThe conclusion that a text message conversation can, in some \ncircumstances, attract a reasonable expectation of privacy does not lea d \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n \n inexorably to the conclusion that an exchange of electronic messages will \nalways attract a reasonable expectation of privacy (see Moldaver  J.’s \nreasons, at paras.  100 and 167 -68); whether a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy in such a conversation is pres ent in any particular case must be \nassessed on those facts by the trial judge .

[Underlining added.]  \n[181]  Implicit in McLachlin  C.J.’s conclusion is the recognition that the “totality \nof the circumstances” test is contingent upon the unique details and context of each \ncase. The then -Chief Justice understood that each case will involve its own distinct \nfactual scenario, requiring an assessment within the circumstances of that case. In a \nconcurring opinion, Rowe  J. recognized the same principle in Marakah , namely that \nwhether a subjective expectation is objectively reasonable “is assessed by a number of \nconsiderations that vary according to the circumstances of each case ” (para.  84 \n(emphasis added)). For his part, Moldaver  J. echoed this sentiment in his dissenting  \nanalysis (see para.  98; see also Knelsen , at para.  38). \n[182]  In my view, the “totality of the circumstances” test would be rendered \nmeaningless if courts were not permitted to evaluate a case within the context of its \nunique circumstances. The connection betwe en an individual and the subject matter of \nthe search “must be examined by looking at the totality of the circumstances in a \nparticular case” ( Marakah , at paras.  98 and 113, per Moldaver  J., dissenting, but not on \nthis point; see also R. v. Spencer , 2014 S CC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para.  17). In \nthis regard, I would reiterate what I wrote in Reeves : “Expectations of privacy in respect \nof certain objects or spaces may be recognized as objectively reasonable in some \ncircumstances, but not in others” (para . 110, citing R. v. M. (M.R.) , [1998] 3 S.C.R. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n \n 393, at para.  33). While general rules surrounding s.  8 protections have developed in \nthe jurisprudence (for a recent example, see R. v. Bykovets , 2024 SCC 6, at para.  14), \nit is critical that the focus remain  on the totality of the circumstances in each case.  \n[183]  Contrary to some lower court findings that a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy will almost always attach to text message conversations (see, e.g., Rafferty , at \npara.  23), our Court’s decision in Marakah  did not create any such rule. Rather, the \nprotection was expressly circumscribed as one that “may” apply “in some cases” \n(para.  4). I share my colleague Rowe  J.’s sense  — expressed during the hearing in the \ninstant appeal  — that once the totality of the cir cumstances test was adopted, a \ncase-by-case assessment became necessary given that each case represents its own \nfacts, circumstances, challenges, and nuances (transcript, at pp.  87-89). Depending on \nthe facts of a case, a court will be required to focus on  certain factors ( Mills , at para.  31, \nper Brown  J., and at para.  62, per Karakatsanis  J.). In this regard, I would agree with \nthe Crown’s characterization of the law during oral argument that “ Marakah  does not \nstand for the proposition that there is automa tic standing when we are talking about text \nmessages” (transcript, at p.  78). With great respect, and as I discuss below, reasoning \nthat rests largely on the proposition that text messaging is a medium of communication \nassociated with the “utmost privacy” and has the potential to disclose intimate personal \ndetails effectively implies that all such communications, by their very nature, attract a \nreasonable expectation of privacy. That is not an accurate reflection of our Court’s \ndecision in Marakah , and goes  beyond the actual state of the law.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n \n C.

The tri al \njudge was entitled to accept some, all, or none of the appellant’s evidence on this issue \nand found that the two individuals generally expected their conversation to be kept \nprivate ( voir dire reasons (reproduced in A.R., at pp.  1-36), at para.  39; see also C.A. \nreasons, 2022 ONCA 666, 163 O.R. (3d) 355, at para.  36). \n[186]  However, I would respectfully part ways with Jamal  J. and the Court of \nAppeal below with respect to whether the appellant’s subjective expectation of privacy \nwas objectively reasonable. My analysis focuses on that issue only. Given my \nconclusion in this regard, I need not address whether the search was authorized by law, \nwhether the law itself was reasonable, and whether the manner in which the search took \nplace was reasonable (see R. v. Col lins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265; R. v. Caslake , [1998] 1 \nS.C.R. 51). It is only necessary to consider those questions after a court finds that an \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n \n applicant has established the test for standing to challenge what would correspondingly \nbe deemed a search for the p urposes of s.  8. Unlike Marakah  and the investigatory \ntechnique employed in that case, the circumstances in the present appeal do not support \nan objectively reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n[187]  My analysis is based on the “totality of the circumstances” test as well as \nthe understanding that assessments under s.  8 are informed by a normative approach \nrather than one that is purely descriptive (see Mills , at para.  20; Tessling , at para.  42). \nHowev er, it is noteworthy that the normative approach should be considered in light of \nthe totality of circumstances specific to the case.  \n[188]  The totality of the circumstances approach has served as the cornerstone of \nour Court’s s.  8 jurisprudence for many years (see, e.g., Patrick ; Reeves ; Mills ; Cole ). \nThis approach cannot be ignored in favour of “value judgments”. While the normative \napproach is important to help ascertain the free and democratic society that reasonable \nand informed Canadians expect to live in (Jamal  J.’s reasons, at para.  48), courts cannot \nlose sight of the totality of the circumstances of the specific cases before them and, \naccordingly, the police conduct therein. The totality of the circumstances test has had \nand continues to have precedenti al value. For the purposes of the present appeal, it is \ntrue that the police cannot peruse the contents of a phone at liberty and without any \nlimits. But their actions may be appropriate if they limit and circumscribe the scope of \ntheir conduct to the inve stigation before them. The holding in Marakah  that a text \nmessage conversation can attract a reasonable expectation of privacy in some cases (at \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n \n paras.  4-5) necessarily leads to the conclusion that there will be situations where a text \nmessage conversation  does not do so.

The holding in Marakah  that a text \nmessage conversation can attract a reasonable expectation of privacy in some cases (at \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n \n paras.  4-5) necessarily leads to the conclusion that there will be situations where a text \nmessage conversation  does not do so. This is one such case.  \n[189]  I turn now to discuss the several factors in this case that support the fact \nthat the appellant’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.  \n(1) Undercover Police Investigations  \n[190]  First, I begin by c onsidering the undercover nature of the investigation.  \n[191]  On numerous occasions, our Court has recognized the important function \nthat undercover police techniques fulfil for the effective operation of our criminal \njustice system. For example, in the child lur ing context, the Court described undercover \nsting operations as “an important tool  — if not the most important tool  — available to \nthe police in detecting offenders who target children and preventing them from doing \nactual harm to children” ( R. v. Friesen , 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para.  94). \nThe protection under s.  8 “does not prevent police from communicating with \nindividuals in the course of an undercover investigation” ( Mills , at para.  42, per \nKarakatsanis  J.). Indeed, in some circumstances th e police must result to subterfuge to \ncombat criminal activity (see R. v. Liew , [1999] 3 S.C.R. 227, at para.  45). This is \nespecially the case as our world faces the evolution of technology in the information \nage and of the devices we use, where “[s]ome of  the most pernicious crimes are the \nhardest to investigate” ( R. v. Ramelson , 2022 SCC 44, at para.  1). As our Court has \nindicated, “[c]ell phones are used to facilitate criminal activity” and are the “‘bread and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n \n butter’ of the drug trade and the means by w hich drugs are marketed on the street” ( R. \nv. Fearon , 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para.  48, citing R. v. Howell , 2011 \nNSSC 284, 313 N.S.R. (2d) 4, at para.  39). \n[192]  I disagree with my colleagues Martin and Moreau  JJ. when they say that \nthe police were  engaged in a technique that was “not analogous to an undercover officer \noperating under the auspice of a fictional persona” (para.  259). In my respectful view, \nthis is exactly what the police were engaged in here. At the voir dire , the trial judge \nfound, and the appellant conceded, that the police lawfully seized Mr.  Gammie’s cell \nphone incident to arrest (paras.  7 and 32). After the police seized the phone, they \nobserved the phone light up and receive four text messages that were visible on the lock \nscree n. The appellant testified that he did not send the first four text messages, which \nwere sent by “Dew”, and that the phone was not his. In fact, the appellant \n“acknowledged that [he] has no standing to object to the [first four] texts between \n‘Dew’ and Mr.  Gammie” ( voir dire  reasons, at para.  34; see also transcript, at pp.  4 and \n75-76). \n[193]  These first four text messages that the police observed triggered their \nsubsequent actions. The record illustrates that when the police observed these \nmessages, which appea red when they were in lawful possession of Mr.  Gammie’s \nphone, they evidently developed some suspicion. It is important to reiterate that the \nofficers had just then arrested Mr.  Gammie for drug -related activity:  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n \n Mr. Gammie was known to the police. He had m any convictions for \ndrug offences. He had been arrested and convicted for selling cocaine. \nSgt. Bair had known Mr.  Gammie since he was 17  years of age. He was \nknown as a street -level dealer or enforcer",

    "text": " had just then arrested Mr.  Gammie for drug -related activity:  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n \n Mr. Gammie was known to the police. He had m any convictions for \ndrug offences. He had been arrested and convicted for selling cocaine. \nSgt. Bair had known Mr.  Gammie since he was 17  years of age. He was \nknown as a street -level dealer or enforcer. Mr.  Gammie had been released \nfrom custody in April  2017. When he came out of jail, he apparently \ncontinued with the same business.  \n \n(voir dire  reasons, at para.  49) \n[194]  The substance of the four text messages that were received was consistent \nwith a drug transaction, namely heroin laced with fentanyl, according to the officer’s \ntestimony accepted at trial (see voir dire  reasons, at paras.  58, 92 and 96). In addition, \nthe confidential informant involved in the investigation advised the police that \nMr. Gammie was dealing in heroin (para.  58). To the police, “Mr.  Gammie [had been] \nleaving to pick up the drugs that were being offered when he was arrested” (para.  57). \nOn a holistic view of the matter, it is clear that from the time they observed the first \nfour text messages, the officers reasonably suspected that they were dealing with a drug \ntransaction that was sufficiently connected to the arrest that had just been made (see, \ngenerally, Fearon , at para.  21 (discussing searches incident to arrest)).  \n[195]  Once again, the evidence accepted at trial was that the appellant did  not \nsend the first four text messages  — Dew sent them. Thus, the appellant had not yet \nengaged in any conversation with Mr.  Gammie (or the police). If there was any \nconversation at all, at that point it was between Dew and Mr.  Gammie, not the \nappellant. A ccording to the evidence, the conversation between the appellant and the \npolice only began when the police, following receipt of Dew’s four text messages, \ncommenced an undercover investigation. As a result, the police became involved in a \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n \n conversation that  was not previously taking place between the appellant and \nMr. Gammie; the conversation had just started. In fact, even if there was any \npre-existing conversation, it did not involve the appellant. The police participated in a \nconversation because they had , on the evidence, formed a suspicion based on \nobjectively discernible facts (see R. v. Chehil , 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at \npara.  3). \n[196]  Unlike in Marakah , where officers searched a suspect’s phone and found \nincriminating messages that were already exchanged, the present matter involved \npolice participating in the electronic exchange as part of an undercover drug \ninvestigation. They did not search a pre -existing conversation, because there was no  \npre-existing conversation between the appellant and Mr.  Gammie. That was readily \napparent from the introductory messages that Dew sent to Mr.  Gammie’s phone. Dew \nhad commenced the conversation at that time. While I recognize that Mills  involved \nthe police’s creation of a completely fictitious person, the appel lant in the present \nappeal happened to be sending text messages to someone whose phone was lawfully in \nthe hands of the police (see Mills , at paras.  44 and 50). As one author points out, this \nwas important for our Court’s decision in Mills : \nFor the majorit y in Mills , this possibility of police “interception” through \npolice participation in the conversation was, in fact, determinative of the \nreasonableness of Mr.  Mills’ expectation of privacy. This is because, \nthough Mr.  Mills was unaware that he was convers ing with a police officer, \nthe police knew that he was conversing with a police officer. The fact that \nthe police were always aware that Mr.  Mills was not communicating with \nan actual child was determinative of the objective reasonableness of his \nexpectati on of privacy. In effect, it was because  the messages were directly \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n \n “intercepted” by the police that Mr.  Mills could not reasonably expect that \nthe messages would be kept private from the state.  \n \n(M.",

Biddulph, “The Privacy Paradox: Marakah , Mills , and the Diminished \nProtections of Section 8” (2020), 43:5 Man. L.J.  161, at p.  187 (emphasis \nin original).)  \n(2) Intrusiveness of Police Conduct  \n[197]  Second, the officers’ “lack of intrusiveness is a factor in the assessment” \n(Tessling , at para.  50, citing R. v. Wong , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, at p. 43; see also Buhay , \nat para.  36; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and \nResearch, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission) , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at p.  594; \nR. v. Plant , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p.  295). It is true that cell phones are capable of \nrevealing deeply private information and that a search of a cell phone “implicates \nimportant privacy interests which are different in both nature and extent from the search \nof other ‘places’” ( Fearon , at para.  51, citing R. v. Vu , 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. \n657, at paras.  38 and 40 -45). From a normative perspective, there is no question that \nthe electronic conversations therein may reveal “details about [individuals’] activities, \ntheir relationships, and even their identities that they would never reveal to the world \nat large” ( Marakah , at para.  36). But strict reliance on this reasoning without \nconsidering the totality of the circumstances would lead to the conclusion that all \nelectronic conversations will att ract a reasonable expectation of privacy. That cannot \nbe the case.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n \n [198]  The fact that electronic communications can reveal a wealth of \nbiographical core information does not mean that every police intrusion into electronic \ncommunications will reveal such inform ation. Tessling is a great illustration of that \nrationale. In that case, Binnie  J., writing for the Court, held that the accused had no \nreasonable expectation of privacy over the heat activity emanating from his home. \nWhile there is a clear and longstandin g privacy interest in the activities that go on in \none’s home, the FLIR technology used by police in that case, which records images of \nheat radiating from a building, revealed little about these activities. It offered “no \ninsight into [the accused’s] priv ate life, and reveal[ed] nothing of his ‘biographical core \nof personal information’” (para.  63). Although the surveillance technology revealed \nsome information related to activities within the accused’s home, a place where “our \nmost intimate and private ac tivities are most likely to take place” (para.  22), there was \nno search within the meaning of s.  8 because of the limitations on the type of \ninformation that could be gathered through FLIR technology. In other words, there was \nno search because of the lack  of intrusiveness of the police technique. In the same vein, \nthe way in which the police carried out the conversation with the appellant in the instant \ncase, making sure not to ask any probing questions or deviate from facilitating the drug \ndeal, ensured t hat no biographical core information was obtained through the \nconversation aside from what was already lawfully known to police from the first four \nmessages.  \n[199]  My colleagues take the position that the police investigative technique was \nespecially intrusive i n this case (Jamal  J.’s reasons , at para.  63; Martin and \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n \n Moreau  JJ.’s reasons, at paras.  258-60).

Respectfully, my colleagues focus too \nnarrowly and categorically on the fact that the appellant thought he was texting \nMr. Gammie without examining the broade r circumstances of the investigative \ntechnique.  \n[200]  To the contrary, the totality of the evidence in this case indicates that the \npolice did not intrusively search Mr.  Gammie’s phone. They did not unlock the phone, \nnor did they search its contents. I agree wit h the Crown that in this case, the nature of \nthe undercover police technique was narrowly circumscribed after the police lawfully \nobserved the first four text messages. Not  only was the nature of the communications \napparent to the police from those message s (i.e., that a conversation was initiated for \nthe purpose of facilitating a drug deal), but they also did not ask any probing questions \nwhen they chose to respond to the messages. In other words, the police did not seek to \nelicit any response that would h ave shed light on the appellant’s biographical core, nor \ndid they search the contents of the phone or any pre -existing communications. Instead , \nthey carefully sought to instruct the appellant as to where they should meet and inquire \nabout how long he would  take to arrive. Indeed, the police were only focused on \nfacilitating and completing the drug transaction. The police learned nothing new about \nthe appellant from the ensuing conversation, nor did they attempt to. In these \ncircumstances, where police take great caution not to discover any new biographical \ncore information, the conversation between the appellant and police can even \nsometimes be less intrusive than, to take my colleagues’ example, answering an \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n \n arrestee’s phone and pretending to be a fictional  person (Martin and Moreau  JJ.’s \nreasons, at para.  259).  \n[201]  I note here that my analysis considers the information known to the police \nbefore the conversation between the officer and the appellant occurred, such as the \nnature of the conversation, which was re vealed in the first four text messages. In \ncontrast, despite purporting to give consideration to the “totality of the circumstances”, \nmy colleague Jamal  J.’s approach would have the police and courts turn a blind eye to \ninformation lawfully known by police  ahead of time for the purposes of the reasonable \nexpectation of privacy analysis, given that the focus is on the potential for the type of \ninformation or the general subject matter of the search (i.e., a text message \nconversation) to reveal biographical c ore information is relevant (para.  57). This is a \nfundamental distinction between our positions.  \n[202]  Keeping the normative approach in mind, there was no potential for \npersonal information revealing core biographical information about the appellant to be \ntrans mitted. It is true that our Court has recognized criminal activity to also be of a \nprivate nature, citing the content neutrality involved in assessments under s.  8 \n(Marakah , at paras.  31-32). But we must be careful not to suggest that, in the context \nof a text message conversation, if the accused was engaged in criminal activity, their \nexpectation of privacy is automatically  objectively reasonable. It is reasonable to \nsuggest that where there is a putative search, there will always  be suspected criminal \nactivity on the other end. The logic would therefore be that the text message \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n \n communications within the context of a criminal investigation would always  reveal \nprivate information (i.e., criminal activity), thereby once again suggesting that an \naccused has a reasonable expectation of privacy in all such communications.  \n[203]  Indeed, Jamal  J.’s approach actually goes beyond the conclusion that every \nputative search of a text message conversation will attract a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy. His reliance on conten t neutrality leads to the logical conclusion that every text \nmessage conversation will attract a reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the \ncontent within it, because it is a conversation that “has the potential or tendency to \nreveal deeply person al and biographical information about the participants” (para.  59). \nThis reasoning would once again cut against McLachlin  C.J.’s point in Marakah  that a \ntext message conversation can attract a reasonable expectation of privacy in some,",

The police did not review pre -existing text messages exchanges \nbetween Mr.  Gammie and anyone else; the first four messages clearly marked the \nbeginning of a conversation, one that the appellant joined only after it had already \nbegun. I n my view, the police’s participation in the conversation on the lock screen was \nakin to the police having lawful possession of a locked cell phone and answering a \nphone call to further an undercover investigation. I respectfully disagree with my \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n \n colleague ’s characterization of the difference between the two (see Jamal  J.’s reasons, \nat para.  70), as I explain further below. In fact, it is reasonable to suggest that an \nundercover officer likely has less control over the circumscribed nature of a phone \nconver sation than that of a text message conversation. Unlike a phone conversation, a \ntext message conversation gives the officer time to prudently prepare a response that \nwould not be probing and that would be narrower in its focus. I agree with the Crown \nthat where the police execute a search warrant and the target’s phone rings, there is \nnothing wrong with the police answering that phone, which has been lawfully secured.  \n[205]  This is not unheard of in the jurisprudence and, as the Court of Appeal \nbelow found and my  colleague Jamal  J. concludes, is not necessarily improper (C.A. \nreasons, at para.  67; Jamal  J.’s reasons, at para.  70). In R. v. Singh (1998), 127 C.C.C. \n(3d) 429, the British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the police did not intercept \na private comm unication but rather simply received a call “from the appellant despite \nthe fact that the appellant was not of the view that he was speaking to a peace officer” \n(para.  4). In R. v. Edwards  (1994), 73 O.A.C. 55, a decision subsequently affirmed by \nthis Cour t ([1996] 1 S.C.R. 128), the Court of Appeal for Ontario saw no issue with the \npolice answering a seized phone several times or even calling numbers they retained \nfrom a pager. The factual circumstances in the case of R. v. Baldree , 2013 SCC 35, \n[2013] 2 S .C.R. 520, also permitted such police conduct. In that case, the police arrested \nthe accused and seized his cell phone, which received a phone call while it was being \nheld at the police station. An officer answered the call and facilitated a drug transacti on \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n \n (see paras.  13-15; see also R. v. Ramsum , 2003 ABQB 45, 329 A.R. 370, at \nparas.  30-31). \n[206]  Indeed, it is also noteworthy that our Court has not treated as a search the \npolice’s ability to themselves  call phone numbers suspected to be associated with the \ndrug trade (see R. v. Ahmad , 2020 SCC 11, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 577). In the case law \nconsidering the law on entrapment, our Court has held that, while reasonable suspicion \nis required before police can pre sent a person with an opportunity to commit an offence, \npolice are permitted to develop this reasonable suspicion once they are actually \nengaged in a conversation with the suspect ( Ahmad , at para.  54). Police are permitted \nto provide a “drop name” to put t he seller at ease, by suggesting they are associated \nwith a person known to them. This",

Police are permitted \nto provide a “drop name” to put t he seller at ease, by suggesting they are associated \nwith a person known to them. This is done partially in order to increase the likelihood \nthat the suspect will trust them. In contrast, the conversation between the appellant and \npolice here involved no d eceptive technique aside from responding by text from \nMr. Gammie’s phone; the police simply responded to facilitate a transaction that was \nevidently already planne d. Although reasonable suspicion was not required in these \ncircumstances, the police certainl y had it in this case.  \n[207]  The fact that text messages themselves inherently create a permanent \nrecord is simply a result of one’s choice to use a written medium; that does not \ntransform the officers’ conduct “into a search or seizure” (see Mills , at paras.  45 and \n48, per Karakatsanis  J.). Once again, the police in this case did not unlock the phone to \nreview its contents or other phone records. They passively received four messages that \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n \n had the hallmarks of a drug deal involving the known suspect whom they had  arrested. \nAfter considering any potentially engaged privacy rights, they responded on the lock \nscreen and did not review any contents of the phone. They were not after any record of \nthe conversation or any information it could provide. Rather, they partic ipated in the \nconversation for the limited and circumscribed purpose of facilitating the drug delivery, \nnothing more (R.F., at para.  49). Nothing they did would “offend society’s notions of \ndecency and fair play” such as impersonating a therapist or a pris on chaplain ( Mills , at \npara.  63). \n[208]  The fact that the police could have  — if they so chose  — answered a phone \ncall from Dew’s phone and facilitated a drug transaction should not change the analysis. \nAside from the practical fact that this may have jeopardize d their investigation, as the \nappellant could have recognized it was not Mr.  Gammie’s voice, there is no meaningful \ndistinction between answering a phone call from Dew’s phone and conversing via text \nwhere the record of the conversation is not what police were after.  \n[209]  My colleague Jamal  J. concludes that his recognition of a privacy interest \nin the circumstances of this case would not prevent undercover police work  — it would \n“merely impos[e] constitutional constraints on police investigations involving text  \nmessaging by requiring that the police comply with s.  8 of the Charter ” (para.  71). My \ncolleague does not explain why this is the case. Indeed, my colleagues Martin and \nMoreau  JJ. make a similar point, stating that recognizing a privacy interest here “doe s \nnot thwart the ability of police to investigate crimes and uncover evidence through \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n \n searches” (para.  261). It just requires them to “have lawful authority to do \nso” — which, in most cases, would require the police to obtain a warrant (para.  261). \nWith re spect, I disagree. To the contrary, adding new “constraints” by requiring police \nto obtain a search warrant will of course impede the ability of police to investigate in a \ngreater amount of cases. Furthermore, this misses the point: the problem is that my \ncolleagues’ approaches make an unprincipled distinction about when s.  8 of the Charter \nshould apply. Section 8 is engaged if this police investigation occurs over text, yet there \nare no impediments to investigating if the police carry on the same investiga tion over \na phone call. As technology and online communications become more ubiquitous, the \nways in which crimes are committed in the online world also evolve (see Mills , at \npara.  39), be it via phone calls, text messages, or other mediums of communication . \nThe police must be permitted to adapt (see Ahmad , at para.  147).  \n(3) Control and Ownership  \n[210]  Third, the concepts of control and ownership are relevant to the \ncircumstances of this case and have both “long been considered relevant” in the context \nof s. 8 protec tion (",

It is true that one’s lack of control over the \nsubject matter of a putative search is not dispositive of the s.  8 inquiry (para.  38). As \nboth McLachlin  C.J., for the majority, and Moldaver  J., dissenting, separately \nrecognized in Marakah , a lack of exclusive control over the subject matter does not \nnecessarily eliminate a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is “one element to be \nconsidered in the totality of the circumstances in determining the objective \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n \n reasonableness of a su bjective expectation of privacy” (para.  38; see also paras.  130-\n31). Similarly, “ownership is relevant, but not determinative” in the inquiry ( Reeves , at \npara.  39). In Reeves , the accused shared a home computer with his spouse. His spouse \ndiscovered child pornography on it, then consented to police entry into the home and \nthe taking of the home computer. However, our Court determined that the accused \nmaintained a reasonable expectation of privacy in that computer.  \n[211]  Given that a reasonable expectation of priv acy may exist on a spectrum \n(Marakah , at para.  29), I am of the view that the appellant’s lack of total control over \nthe conversation and ownership of the phone, as reflected in the record, support a \nsignificantly diminished expectation of privacy which is  not objectively reasonable in \nthe circumstances of this case. With respect to control, the appellant had, at best, a \nshared control with Dew over the phone that he was using to communicate with \nMr. Gammie. While it is true that the subject matter is the e lectronic communication at \nissue and not the phone itself, I agree with the Crown that the place where that \nconversation occurs remains as “one of several factors that must be weighed” \n(Marakah , at para.  30; R.F., at para.  40; see also Jamal  J.’s reasons, at para.  53). Indeed, \nas McLachlin  C.J. recognized in Marakah , “I may have a high expectation of privacy \nin my own phone, which I completely control, a lesser expectation of privacy in my \nfriend’s phone , which I expect her to control, and no reasonable exp ectation of privacy \nat all if I expect the text message to be displayed to the public” (para.  29 (emphasis \nadded)). In the present case, the evidence is to the effect that the phone was Dew’s and \nwas given to the appellant to facilitate the drug transactio n. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n \n [212]  To that end, the factor of ownership plays an equally important role in this \ncase. The appellant’s evidence was that the phone he was using was not his own; it \nbelonged to Dew and he only borrowed it when he was delivering drugs. In addition, \nthe four t ext messages did not come from him but were sent by Dew to Mr.  Gammie. \nThe phone itself was also to be returned to Dew following the completed delivery ( voir \ndire reasons , at para.  33). The appellant’s lack of ownership over both the phone and \nthe first fo ur messages is closely related to his lack of control over them. At best, the \nappellant was borrowing Dew’s phone, and the two had a shared control over the \ncommunications that came after the first four messages. This diminishes the appellant’s \nclaim to an  objectively reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n[213]  In Marakah , McLachlin  C.J. expressly contemplated that, while there was \na reasonable expectation of privacy in the electronic conversation between \nMr. Marakah and his accomplice, which was accessed on the lat ter’s device, “different \nfacts may well lead to a different result” (para.  55). McLachlin  C.J. noted that it was \nnot a case of “messages posted on social media, conversations occurring in crowded \nInternet chat rooms, or comments posted on online message bo ards”",

McLachlin  C.J. noted that it was \nnot a case of “messages posted on social media, conversations occurring in crowded \nInternet chat rooms, or comments posted on online message bo ards” (para.  55). These \nexamples illustrate that the more people that are involved in a conversation and the less \ncontrol one has over who might see it, the more likely it is that one’s subjective \nexpectation of privacy will not be objectively reasonable.  \n[214]  Mr. Marakah’s reasonable expectation of privacy was diminished due to \nhis lack of control in a two-party  electronic conversation on cell phones that were \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n \n owned by the parties to the conversation . From the appellant’s own evidence, we can \ngather that at lea st three people had access to the conversation here: Mr.  Gammie, who \nowned the phone; Dew, who sent the first four text messages; and the appellant. The \nappellant decided to continue the conversation despite his suspicion that he was texting \nsomeone else b ecause the messages sent were out of character for Mr.  Gammie (A.R., \npart V, vol.  I, at pp.  312-16). This added a potential fourth party to the conversation \nfrom his perspective. All of this occurred on a phone that the appellant borrowed only \nfor the purp ose of carrying out drug deliveries and that he expected to return after the \ndeal had been concluded (pp.  305-10). If Mr.  Marakah’s expectation of privacy was \nalready diminished in his case, the fact that there was even less control in the present \ncase suggests that the appellant’s expectation of privacy was significantly diminished \nand, indeed, entirely negated when we consider the totality of the circumstances.  \n[215]  Furthermore, the analysis of both control and ownership in this case must \nbe tied to the relati onship between the individuals involved. Our Court has said that the \nrelationship between the parties to the conversation may too factor into the s.  8 analysis \n(see Plant , at p.  293). In Mills , the Court placed significant emphasis on the lack of a \nrelatio nship between Mr.  Mills and the “child” who happened to be the police. For \nexample, Brown  J. repeatedly highlighted the fact that Mr.  Mills was dealing with \nsomeone “who was a stranger to him” (paras.  4, 22, 24, 27 and 30). In my opinion, he \nfocused on the  relationship for the limited purpose of emphasizing that the police \ncreated a fictitious person; the relationship was therefore known to them, and there was \nno risk that the police would breach the boundaries of that pre -existing conversation.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n \n [216]  It is then important to highlight the evidence of the existing relationship in \nthe present case, which shows that the appellant barely knew Mr.  Gammie. Unlike the \naccused in Marakah , the appellant here never asked Mr.  Gammie to keep their \nelectronic communications private; nor did he ask him to delete any of the messages. \nAs the Crown appropriately emphasized, the appellant’s evidence was unclear about \nwhether or not he knew Mr.  Gamm ie (R.F., at para.  40). In the appellant’s testimony, \nhe suggested that he had never met Mr.  Gammie, yet he later admitted to having \ndelivered drugs to him before. His evidence was inconsistent. Perhaps more important, \nhowever, is the fact that he suspecte d that the person he was sending text messages to \nmay not have been Mr.  Gammie (see I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at para.  25). \n[217]  Viewing the matter normatively, I would return to my earlier comments \nabout the nature of the text messages, the locked scr een, and the circumscribed nature \nof the police investigation and text message responses. These circumstances would \nhave made clear to the police the fact that they were not breaching the confines of a \ngiven relationship or reviewing any prior conversation s. To reiterate, the police knew \nthe text messages related to a drug transaction involving Mr.  Gammie, whom they had \njust arrested for drug -related activity.

Instead, they simply and \ncarefully sought to instruct the appellant as to where they should meet and to inquire \nabout how long he would take to arrive. Having regard to what the first four messages \nrevealed, “[t]he police could, therefore, confidently and accurately conclude that no \ns. 8 concern would arise from their reviewing these particular communications” given \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 125 ---\n \n the circumscribed nature of the police investigation and their associated text messages \nsent from the phone’s lock screen to the appellant (see Mills , at para.  27, per Brown  J.). \nIndeed, “what the police were really after” was the facilitation of the drug transaction \n(see Reeves , at para.  29, regarding how to define the subject matter of a putative \nsearch).  \n(4) Conclusion on Reasonable Expectatio n of Privacy  \n[218]  Applying the totality of the circumstances test as well as having regard for \nthe normative approach that informs our s.  8 jurisprudence and for the factual record in \nthis case, I find that the appellant’s subjective expectation of privacy was not \nobjectively reasonable. In my view, suggesting that the police should have simply \nclosed their eyes to the first four text messages and not investigated after having lawful \npossession of the phone would cut against the “essential role of the police  . . . to \ninvestigate crimes” ( R. v. Storrey , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at p.  254) and “the maintenance \nof law and order and the security of Canadian society” ( R. v. Mentuck , 2001 SCC 76, \n[2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, at para.  51). It remains important that “principle and p racticality \nmust not be strangers in the application of s.  8” (Marakah , at para.  89, per Rowe  J.).

However, I find it necessary to \ncomment on a few aspects of the analysis of my colleagues Martin and Moreau  JJ. that \nmay have c onsequences for future cases.  \n(a) Interception  \n[220]  After concluding that the appellant had  a reasonable expectation of privacy \nin the circumstances, my colleagues Martin and Moreau  JJ. state that “this Court lacks \nthe requisite basis to pronounce conclusively on w hich statutory provision would \npermit a court to authorize [the police] conduct”, given the absence of full argument \nand of the benefit of the consideration of the Court of Appeal on this issue (para.  277). \nNevertheless, they say this immediately after sev eral paragraphs of analysis that imply \nclearly that the actions of police in this case would amount to an interception.  \n[221]  In my respectful view, generally speaking, where it is acknowledged that \nour Court should not rule on an issue without the benefit of fu ll argument and \nconsideration from the Court of Appeal below, we should be careful not to nonetheless \nprovide a significant analysis of the issue. Though Martin and Moreau  JJ. may not \nintend to rule definitively on the issue, I believe that caution is warr anted in the \ncircumstances. In my view, it is enough for the purposes of their analysis to only say \nthat no warrant was obtained.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n \n [222]  More importantly, however, I wish to comment on the consequences that \nmy colleagues’ implicit finding  — that is, that the inve stigation in this case amounted \nto an interception",

This implicit finding \nwould go above and beyond the consequences of finding only that there is a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in circumstances where police ass ume the identity of a third \nparty in a text message conversation.  \n[223]  Finding that the conduct of police here required some form of Part  VI \nauthorization rather than a general warrant under s.  487.01 of the Criminal Code , \nR.S.C. 1985, c.  C-46, is not merely a matter of choosing which type of authorization is \nneeded between two similar provisions with nearly identical requirements. Part  VI \nimposes greater hurdles to obtaining authorization. Martin and Moreau  JJ.’s description \nof the police “interject[ing] themse lves into the communication process between \nMr. Campbell and Mr.  Gammie  in real time” suggests that third -party wiretap \nauthorization would be required in the circumstances (para.  272 (emphasis added)). \nPursuant to s.  186 of the Criminal Code , this would r equire the police to establish, \namong other things, investigative necessity in order to obtain authorization to carry on \nthe conversation.  \n[224]  Even where police are not assuming an identity and are instead creating a \nfictitious one, applying my colleagues’ log ic would mean that in any situation where \npolice are carrying on a text message conversation with a suspect, this would constitute \nparticipant surveillance under Part  VI, and would therefore require judicial \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n \n authorization. Police could not, for example, te xt a suspected “dial -a-dope” line to \ninvestigate, or engage in any text conversation investigation with a suspect unless they \nobtained prior judicial authorization under Part  VI of the Criminal Code . Authorization \nfor participant surveillance does not have  the same investigative necessity requirement \nas third -party wiretaps (see Criminal Code , s. 184.2; R.  W. Hubbard, M.  Lai and \nD. Sheppard, Wiretapping and Other Electronic Surveillance: Law and Procedure  \n(loose -leaf), at §  2:8). Nonetheless, it still requi res more from police than a general \nwarrant would ( R. v. TELUS Communications Co. , 2013 SCC 16, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 3, at \npara.  27). This would undoubtedly create significant hurdles for law enforcement \ninvestigations.  \n(b) Exigent Circumstances  \n[225]  Within their exigen t circumstances analysis, my colleagues comment that \npolice should have pursued alternative investigative techniques, given that there was \nno imminent safety risk. They note that “[p]olice were in a position to locate Dew as \nthey could have sought judicial  authorization for a production order to obtain the \ninformation associated with Dew’s cell phone number” (Martin and Moreau  JJ.’s \nreasons, at para.  331).  \n[226]  In my view, this Court should avoid speculating about what other potential \ninvestigative techniques wo uld have succeeded in the absence of a proper evidentiary \nfoundation to support it. Even if police could have hypothetically applied for a \nproduction order to obtain the information associated with Dew’s cellphone number, it \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n \n is not necessarily true that th ey could have done this quickly enough to continue this \ninvestigation successfully. By the time police obtained a production order, the person \nusing Dew’s phone might have heard about Mr.  Gammie’s arrest, might have done \nsomething else with the drugs or ab andoned the deal, or might have gotten rid of the \nphone itself. It is also unclear whether obtaining the information related to the owner \nof the phone would be enough to locate whoever was using Dew’s phone.  \n(c) Section 24(2)  \n[227]  Furthermore, I take issue with the  way in which my colleagues Martin and \nMoreau  JJ. carry out their s.  24(2) Charter  analysis.

In my view, some of the factors \nthat would clearly mitigate the seriousness of the Charter -infringing state conduct or \nthe impact of the breach on the appellant’s Charter -protected interests are either not \nconsidered as mitigating, or are instead considered as aggravating factors. My \ncolleagues’ perception of the intrusiveness of the police technique seems to have \ncoloured their analysis of the facts.  \n[228]  For example, w ith respect to the first factor in R. v. Grant , 2009 SCC 32, \n[2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, my colleagues state that the police officers’ experience and \nfamiliarity with the law in this case aggravates the seriousness of the breach, as “the \nlaw on warrantless search es is well settled and the officers involved had decades of \nexperience” (para.  341).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n \n [229]  The officers’ knowledge must be placed in the appropriate context. Recall \nthat this investigation occurred in June  2017, before our Court’s decision in Marakah . \nAt that ti me, the law in Ontario was that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy \nin a co -accused’s cell phone, per the Court of Appeal for Ontario’s decision  in 2016 \n(R. v. Marakah , 2016 ONCA 542, 131 O.R. (3d) 561).The officers considered whether \nthe appell ant had a privacy interest in the text message conversation, and concluded \nthat he did not, given that it was a conversation on Mr. Gammie’s phone ( voir dire  \nreasons , at paras.  69 and 72). This was entirely in accordance with the law of Ontario \nat the time . \n[230]  If the police believed there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the \ntext message conversation, because that was, in fact, the law, it is unclear why they \nwould think that a privacy interest would materialize if they replied to the messages. \nThis is especially so because the police would have also known at that time that they \nwere permitted to answer phone calls on seized phones and talk to the person on the \nother end. There was consequently no reason at all for police to think that interjecting \nthemselves into that conversation was a problem at the time. They also knew that they \nwere only replying to the texts without unlocking the phone ( voir dire  reasons , at \npara.  68). Most importantly, the police believed that the situation was urgent (paras.  69 \nand 72).  \n[231]  In light of this situation, we cannot fault the police for their knowledge that \nwarrantless searches are presumed to be unconstitutional. They would of course know \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n \n this. But the officers also thought that they did not have time to obtain a warra nt, that \nthere was no reason to obtain one as the appellant had no reasonable expectation of \nprivacy in the text messages on Mr.  Gammie’s phone, and that the circumstances were \nurgent. Furthermore, contrary to what Martin and Moreau  JJ. say, at para.  342 o f their \nreasons, it is completely understandable that none of these officers testified as to which \nwarrant would have been required to authorize their investigative technique  — they did \nnot think there was a “search” to authorize to begin with.  \n[232]  With respec t to the second Grant factor, the fact that the conversation \n“taken as a whole” reflected the appellant’s criminal lifestyle should not have increased \nthe impact of the breach on his Charter -protected interests (Martin and Moreau  JJ.’s \nreasons, at para.  348). This is because the police already lawfully knew from the first \nfour messages, which established the nature of the conversation, that whoever \nresponded to that conversation was involved in criminal activity. This should lessen \nthe impact on the appella nt’s privacy interests.  \n[233]  As to the assessment of whether the administration of justice would be \nbrought into disrepute by the admission of evidence, where the circumstances of the \npolice investigation",

Conclusion  \n[235]  Whether parties to text messages conversa tions have a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in their electronic communications will vary on a case -to-case \nbasis. Courts must conduct inquiries under s.  8 with a view to considering the totality \nof the circumstances of a given case. Indeed, those circum stances will more often than \nnot be unique to a particular case. While the normative function of the inquiry is \nimportant, the record and circumstances of a case must not and cannot be ignored; \ndoing so would ignore the totality of the circumstances test t hat has been the \ncornerstone of our Court’s s.  8 jurisprudence.  \n[236]  In this case, the police passively received four text messages on a phone \nwhich was in their lawful possession after they arrested the owner of the phone, \nMr. Gammie, for drug -related activity. They believed that those text messages were \ntied to the arrest they had just made. After contemplating the privacy interests at stake, \nthey conducted an undercover investigation by responding to the text messages on a \nlocked screen, in a circumsc ribed manner, and without any inquiries beyond how long \nthe appellant was going to take to arrive at the agreed -upon destination. The police did \nnot conduct a search of Mr.  Gammie’s phone. Rather, they participated in the text \nmessage conversation for the narrow purpose of facilitating the suspected drug \ntransaction.  \n[237]  For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n \n  The reasons of Karakatsanis, Martin and Moreau JJ. were delivered by  \n MARTIN AND MOREAU JJ. —  \nI. Overview   \n[238]  This appeal involves police conduct during a drug investigation and asks \nthe Court to assess whether a particular investigative technique engaged the accused’s \nreasonable expectation of privacy under s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and \nFreedoms ; cla rify the scope and proper application of the doctrine of exigent \ncircumstances in a manner consonant with s. 8 of the Charter ; and determine the \nadmissibility of the evidence obtained under s. 24(2) of the Charter . \n[239]  The nature of the impugned state action p lays an important role in \nanalyzing and addressing these important legal issues. The  police arrested Kyle \nGammie for drug trafficking, seized his phone and saw part of a text message \nconversation between him and “Dew” . Subsequently, and w ithout any form of  prior \njudicial authorization, the police decided to use the seized cell phone. For \napproximately two hours, the police took control of the phone and pretended to be Mr. \nGammie in a series of text message communications with “Dew”. During that time, \n“Dew”,  who turned out to be the appellant, Dwayne Campbell, was unaware he was \ncommunicating with the police and not Mr.  Gammie. The police asked Dew to deliver \nheroin worth $1250 to Mr. Gammie’s house, where the police were at the time. When \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n \n Mr. Campbell arrive d at Mr. Gammie’s residence with the requested drugs, the police \narrested him and charged him with the offences at issue on this appeal.  \n[240]  Mr. Campbell challenges the legality of the manner in which the police \nused Mr. Gammie’s phone to communicate with him  to arrange this drug transaction. \nHe seeks the exclusion of the evidence obtained by police on the basis that their chosen \ninvestigative technique did not respect his s. 8 Charter  rights or comply with this \nCourt’s jurisprudence on lawful search and seizu",

In prompting \nand exchanging messages with Mr. Campbell while impersonating Mr. Gammie, a real \nperson known to Mr. Cam pbell, the police facilitated a fresh and different drug \ntransaction, acquiring private, real -time communications on an ongoing basis. Because \nthe communications took the form of text messages, the police understood they were \nalso creating a written record  of everything said in their text -based conversation. The \npolice explained that they shifted their focus after Mr. Gammie’s arrest to the person \nsending text messages to his phone because they believed the heroin may have \ncontained fentanyl and wanted to  prevent its sale to someone other than the police.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n \n [242]  We agree that Mr. Campbell had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his \ncommunications and that his s. 8 Charter right was engaged. Conversations that take \nplace over text messaging promise participants a  high degree of privacy and are capable \nof revealing a great deal of personal information ( R. v. Marakah , 2017 SCC 59, [2017] \n2 S.C.R. 608). Parliament has set out various ways in which prior judicial authorization \nmay be sought for state action which thre atens a person’s reasonable expectation of \nprivacy. Here the police did not seek or obtain any such authorization and their \nwarrantless search was therefore a prima facie breach of s. 8 — unless they could \nestablish the existence of special circumstances r ecognized in law as justifying their \nactions. Courts have understandably defined these situations with care and specificity.  \n[243]  We agree with Jamal J. that the impugned investigative technique of \nimpersonating Mr. Gammie in a text message conversation could not be justified by \nthe common law power of search incident to arrest.  \n[244]  We also reject the Crown’s argument, based on a consistent line of \nauthority that supports the exceptional use of warrantless search powers in situations \nof true urgency, that this warr antless search was lawful because the police thought there \nwere “exigent circumstances” and could not obtain a warrant in time. In our view, when \nproperly understood in light of its limited purpose and cautious jurisprudential \nevolution, the doctrine of ex igent circumstances does not justify the search in this case.  \n[245]  Even accepting that the quantity and type of drugs involved posed a \npotential risk of harm to public safety, we find the circumstances fall well short of the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n \n requirement of an imminent risk to an individual or group. Any claimed risk was not \nimminent or immediate in the legally required senses and could only have materialized \nafter two or more subsequent possible events occurred. Simply stated, the jurisprudence \ndoes not support a conclusion tha t the potential sale and subsequent use of a harmful \ndrug constitutes exigency in the absence of a risk of imminent danger to police or public \nsafety. The f acts of this case do not establish an imminent safety risk justifying \nwarrantless police action and there were therefore no  exigent circumstances that \njustified the warrantless search under s. 11(7) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances \nAct, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (“ CDSA ”).  \n[246]  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the police actions breached \nMr. Campbel l’s s. 8 Charter  rights and that to admit the evidence derived from the \nelectronic conversation would bring the administration of justice into disrepute under \ns. 24(2) of the Charter . We would therefore allow the appeal,  set aside the appellant’s \nconvictions, and enter acquittals . \nII. Background  \n[247",

We would therefore allow the appeal,  set aside the appellant’s \nconvictions, and enter acquittals . \nII. Background  \n[247]  On the afternoon of June 14, 2017, members of the Guelph Police Service’s \nDrug Unit arrested Mr. Gammie for drug offences outside his residence. Mr. Gammie \nwas known to police as a “s treet-level dealer or enforcer” ( voir dire  reasons \n(reproduced in A.R., at pp.  1-36), at para. 49). Based on confidential information that \nMr. Gammie was involved in drug trafficking, police placed him under surveillance \nand obtained a search warrant for h is apartment. He was arrested at approximately \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n \n 4:25 p.m. as he was leaving the apartment building. During the arrest, a member of the \nsurveillance team, Officer Kendall Brown, noticed Mr. Gammie toss two cellphones \non the passenger seat of his car and seiz ed them incident to arrest. Officer Brown gave \nthe cellphones to the exhibits officer, Officer Andrew Orok. They were brought into \nMr. Gammie’s residence where the search warrant was being executed.  \n[248]  Around 4:50  p.m., police became aware that one of the sei zed cellphones \nwas displaying incoming, unread text messages from someone named “Dew” on the \nlocked screen. Counsel for the appellant conceded in oral submissions that Dew was \nMr. Campbell. Four messages were visible:  \nFamily I need 1250 for this half tho  \n \nYooo  \n \nWhat you gonna need that cause I don’t want to drive around with it  \n \nWhat time you gonna need it  \n \n(voir dire  reasons, at para. 10)  \n[249]  The first message had arrived at approximately 4:31  p.m., and the next \nthree at 4:50  p.m. Officer Orok brought the messages to the attention of Sergeant Ben \nBair, the senior officer in charge of the investigation. Sgt. Bair testified that, based on \nhis exp erience in drug investigations in the Guelph area and the comparatively lower \nprice of $1250 for such quantity, he believed that the messages related to a drug \ntransaction for heroin laced with fentanyl, and not the sale of pure heroin. During the \nvoir dir e he also explained how, at the time, 75 percent of the heroin in Guelph was \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n \n believed to be laced with fentanyl. He was concerned that if they lost the sale, the drugs \nwould cause deaths “either in our community or elsewhere” (A.R., part V, vol. I, at \np. 59).   \n[250]  The three officers had a short conversation lasting a minute or a minute \nand a half and came to believe there were exigent circumstances allowing them to \ncontinue the conversation with Dew from Mr. Gammie’s phone. In their discussion, \nthey considered  that they had seized Mr. Gammie’s phone legally incident to arrest, \nand had not attempted to unlock it. They believed that only Mr. Gammie had a \nreasonable expectation of privacy in the phone, but did not think the search warrant \nobtained earlier in the d ay for the apartment would permit them to search a phone seized \nfrom the car. They also considered whether following up on the information on the \nscreen would be entrapment, but ultimately thought it was not. Because the texts \nsuggested to the officers tha t Dew was impatient and the transaction involved heroin \ncontaining fentanyl, the police wanted to ensure delivery of the drugs “to take [it] off \nthe street before it was sold to someone else” ( voir dire reasons, at para. 69).  \n[251]  The police testified that at that time of day, they would have had to obtain \na telewarrant, but they felt they did not have time to do so as it would risk losing the \npotential sale. Sgt. Bair testified that he felt that they did not have time to obtain a \nwarrant, because if it took to o long for Mr. Gammie to respond to the messages, Dew \nwould assume he had been arrested and traffic the drugs to",

Bair instructed Officer Orok to participate in the conversation with \nDew by impersonating Mr. Gammie. The objective of this chosen investigative \ntechnique was to ensure the delivery of the drugs to Mr. Gammie’s residence. The \npolice were able to see and respond to the messages from the locked screen without \nfurther accessing the phone’s content. Sgt. Bair confirmed in his testi mony that police \nbegan participating in the conversation with Dew at approximately 4:50  p.m. and \nMr. Campbell was ultimately arrested at 7:05  p.m.  \n[253]  During this approximately two -hour period, Officer Orok exchanged \n35 messages with Dew, who was in fact Mr. Campbell as he later confirmed. \nImpersonating Mr. Gammie, Officer Orok first responded to Mr. Campbell at 4:51 p.m. \nIn his messages to Mr.  Campbell, Officer Orok confirmed interest in the new heroin \ntransaction, and directed Mr. Campbell to bring the drugs  to Mr. Gammie’s residence. \nHe followed up a number of times to find out how long it would take for Mr. Campbell \nto arrive. When Mr. Campbell wanted to speak on the phone, and called another of \nMr. Gammie’s phones unprompted, Officer Orok stated that someo ne else had the \nphone in order to allay Mr. Campbell’s suspicion. Officer Orok’s messages were aimed \nat ensuring the delivery would be completed, and provided instructions to the residence \nand about where to enter the building.  \n[254]  All three officers waited in  the residence for the approximately two hours \nuntil Mr.  Campbell arrived. Sgt. Bair cancelled the arrival of additional officers to \nMr. Gammie’s residence while they waited and the execution of the warrant was \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n \n paused. Officer Orok engaged in the text comm unications and, apart from discussing \nthe incoming texts, there was little other activity in the residence. There is no evidence \nin the record indicating that any further consideration was given to obtaining a warrant.  \n[255]  When Mr. Campbell arrived at the side  door of Mr. Gammie’s apartment \nbuilding, he removed a red running shoe that had been placed to leave the door ajar, as \ndiscussed in his messages with Officer Orok. He arrived at the door of Mr. Gammie’s \nresidence holding the shoe, where officers were wait ing in uniform and informed him \nhe was under arrest. Mr. Campbell attempted to run away, but was apprehended, \narrested, and searched. Police seized a cellphone, 14.33 grams of heroin mixed with \nfentanyl, and $40 cash. The phone seized from Mr. Campbell was  still displaying \nmessages on screen from the conversation with Officer Orok. The police then scrolled \nthrough Mr. Campbell’s phone and took photographs of the text messages, triggering \na subsequent breach under s. 8 of the Charter .  \n[256]  What happened and the precise nature of the police conduct at issue bears \non the central legal questions in this case, specifically, whether this state action engaged \nand breached Mr. Campbell’s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure \nunder s. 8 of the Charter ; whether the police can justify their actions based on what \nthey argue were “exigent circumstances”; and whether the admission of the evidence \nso obtained would bring the administration of justice into disrepute according to the \nfactors our Court must conside r under s. 24(2) of the Charter . \nIII.

    "text": "  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n \n A. Mr. Campbell Had a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in the Electronic \nCommunications  \n[257]  We agree with our colleague Jamal J. and the Court of Appeal that \nMr. Campbell had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his el ectronic \ncommunications with the police (Jamal J.’s reasons, at para. 41; C.A. reasons, 2022 \nONCA 666, 163 O.R. (3d) 355, at para.  33). We further agree that the totality of the \ncircumstances remains the correct approach to assessing whether a claimant has  a \nreasonable expectation of privacy (Jamal J.’s reasons, at para. 40), including in cases \nwhere there is an undercover aspect to the police conduct ( R. v. Duarte , [1990] 1 S.C.R. \n30). Even if there are features of the investigative technique that do not b reach the \nindividual’s privacy rights (e.g., the plain view of incoming text messages), the court \ncannot rely on those features to justify aspects of the investigation which do have an \nimpact on privacy. Rather, the focus must remain on the potential of a given technique \nto reveal private information in the totality of the circumstances.  \n[258]  Given the nature of the police conduct at issue, we add that the breach of \nthis privacy interest should be understood as involving a high degree of intrusion. By \nchoosing, creating and employing this specific investigative technique, the police did \nnot merely search a phone or passively monitor private text communications: they \nactively inserted themselves into a conversation “between two real people with a pre -\nexisting rela tionship, essentially hijacking the identity of one of the participants” (C.A. \nreasons, at para. 71).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n \n [259]  The technique of hijacking an existing identity in such circumstances \ncreates a particularly insidious invasion by police. It is not a technique our Cour t has \npreviously considered in the context of s. 8 of the Charter  and it is not analogous to an \nundercover officer operating under the auspice of a fictional persona (see, e.g., R. v. \nMills , 2019 SCC 22, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 320;  R. v. Hart , 2014 SCC 52, [2014]  2 S.C.R. \n544). Nor is it the same as an officer answering an arrestee’s phone and, again, \npretending to be a fictional person (see, e.g., R. v. Baldree , 2013 SCC 35, [2013] 2 \nS.C.R. 520, where the Court considered whether an officer’s testimony regarding a \ndrug purchase call was inadmissible hearsay).  \n[260]  Further, in phone conversations the ability to impersonate a person known \nto the caller is limited and there is a real risk the caller will recognize the deception. \nThis is well illustrated by the police’s e fforts to avoid answering calls from \nMr. Campbell. In contrast, within a text conversation, the potential for police to \nimpersonate the recipient and deceive the sender is limited only by their opportunities \nto do so and the strictures of the law. Under th e normative inquiry for assessing a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, the state should not be allowed to penetrate our \npersonal relationships and then manipulate the bonds of those relationships to elicit \ninformation or specific conduct, absent lawful aut hority ( R. v. Bykovets , 2024 SCC 6, \nat paras. 7 and 52 -53). The deception (and effectiveness) of this technique is predicated \non exploiting an existing relationship between private actors, which has the potential \nto reveal to police deeply personal informa tion. It would gravely impact our trust in \ngeneral, and in the state, if the last text we received from an acquaintance or family \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 143 ---\n \n member was, instead, from the police in disguise. This investigative technique corrodes \nthe dignity and autonomy established t hrough personal, private relationships.  \n[261]  Recognizing that in a free and democratic society the privacy claim in \npersonal text conversations between individuals known to one another must be “beyond \nstate intrusion absent constitutional justification” does no t thwart the ability of police \nto investigate crimes and uncover evidence through searches ( R. v.

It simply require s police to have lawful \nauthority to do so. Once police have already obtained a search warrant, as was the case \nin CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, \nor have other lawful authority, police are permitted to “uneart h and preserve as much \nrelevant evidence as possible” (para. 22) within the parameters of the relevant \nauthority.  \n[262]  In sum, Mr. Campbell had a reasonable expectation of privacy in these \ncircumstances and therefore s. 8 of the Charter  is engaged. We turn now  to the police’s \nactions and what authority, if any, they had to act as they did.  \nB. This Was a Warrantless Search  \n[263]  Our law of search and seizure recognizes the importance of privacy rights \nand has consistently favoured a system of accountability requiring jus tification of their \ntransgression prior to an intrusion by the state ( Hunter v. Southam Inc. , [1984] 2 S.C.R. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n \n 145, at pp. 160 -61; R. v. Vu , 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at paras. 22 -24; \nBykovets , at para. 88).  \n[264]  In this case, the police did not attempt to secure any form of judicial \nauthorization before they decided to impersonate Mr. Gammie and use his phone to \nparticipate in a real -time text message conversation with Mr. Campbell.  \n[265]  Factually, no evidence clarifi es which particular type of warrant they \nbelieved they would have needed. Legally, this case has been argued in relation to \ns. 11(7) of the CDSA , but it is unclear how the investigative technique used in this case \ncould have been authorized under s. 11(1).  It would have been plain to the police that \nthey were about to engage in the search and seizure of real -time communications on an \nongoing basis. Acquisition of such evidence exceeds the powers described in s. 11 of \nthe CDSA . Subsections (1), (5) and (6) o f s. 11 allow the police to search for and seize \nevidence or things they believe to already exist (e.g., evidence that “is in a place” \n(s. 11(1)), or evidence that the person searched “has on their person” (s.  11(5)), or \nexisting evidence that may not be m entioned in the warrant (s. 11(6))) (see R. v. Paris , \n2015 ABCA 33, 320 C.C.C. (3d) 102, at para. 17; S.  C. Hutchison et al., Search and \nSeizure Law in Canada  (loose -leaf), at § 16:10 ). \n[266]  While the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.  C‐46,  provides certain option s, \nwe heard little argument about the types of authorization which may have been sought \nfor such police conduct. Whether this conduct was an interception under Part VI of the \nCriminal Code  was raised by Mr. Campbell in the courts below, and before this Cou rt \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n \n in oral argument. Mr. Campbell also suggested for the first time before this Court that \na general warrant should have been sought by the police before embarking on and \nengaging in this particular conduct (transcript, at pp.  20 and 131 -32).   \n[267]  The unusual nature of the technique may require authorization under a \ngeneral warrant pursuant to s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code .

Keeshan, The Law of \nSearch and Seizur e in Canada (13th ed. 2024), at pp. 675 -76). In contrast with s. 11 of \nthe CDSA , a general warrant may be issued with respect to an anticipatory offence and \nevidence that does not yet exist ( R. v. Noseworthy  (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.); R. \nv. Lucas , 2014 ONCA 561, 121 O.R. (3d) 303, at paras. 110 and 113 -14; R. v. Ly , 2016 \nABCA 229; B.  A. MacFarlane, R.  J. Frater and C.  Michaelson, Drug Offences in \nCanada  (4th ed. (loose -leaf)), at § 25:39).  \n[268]  We do not endorse the view that the investigative technique crafted and \nadopted by the police here cannot be an “intercept” within the meaning of Part VI of \nthe Criminal Code . Jamal J.’s analysis runs counter to this Court’s broad interpretation \nof Part VI  (TELUS , at paras. 23 -25, 40 and 43). Respectfully, a narrow focus on the \n“need for a separate ‘device or apparatus ’” (Jamal J.’s reasons, at paras. 98 -99) fails to \nmeaningfully grapple with “the substance of the police investigative technique” \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n \n (TELUS , at para. 62). Instead, the analysis concentrates on the technique’s “formal \ntrappings” (paras. 62 and 77). This Court has cautioned against a formalistic \ninterpretation of Part VI that considers the “technical differences” between various \nmodes of acquisition  too narrowly (paras. 3 -5 and 24 -25).  \n[269]  The Criminal Code  does not require the use of a separate device to \nconstitute an intercept. Section 184(1) makes it an offence to knowingly intercept a \nprivate communication “by means of any electro -magnetic, acoustic , mechanical or \nother device”. Section 183 of the Criminal Code defines “electro -magnetic, acoustic, \nmechanical or other device” as “any device  or apparatus that is used or is capable of \nbeing used  to intercept a private communication”. The phrase encompas ses a wide \nvariety of devices from the “most complex satellite surveillance system to a glass \npressed up against a wall to hear a conversation in the next room” (R.  W. Hubbard, \nM. Lai and D.  Sheppard, Wiretapping and Other Electronic Surveillance: Law and \nProcedure  (loose‐leaf), at § 1:4). In drafting the definition, Parliament intended to \ncover “all possible methods of intercepting private communications with the exception \nof normal human hearing” ( ibid.). This is confirmed by a purposive and contextual \ninterpretation of the provisions, including the broad definition of “intercept” in s. 183 \nof the Criminal Code , which “includes listen to, record or acquire a communication or \nacquire the substance, meaning or purport thereof”.  \n[270]  On a plain reading of s. 183,  a “recipient’s device (after it has been \nappropriated by police) is one that can be used to ‘intercept a private communication’” \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n \n (S.

Penney, “Consent Searches for Electronic Text Communications: Escaping the \nZero -Sum Trap” (2018), 56 Alta. L. Rev.  1, at p . 25).  \n[271]  In addition, the fact that an authorization issued under Part VI includes the \nauthority to install or remove a device covertly ( Criminal Code , s. 186(5.1)) does not \nmean that only interceptions involving a separate device distinct from the medium o f \ncommunication used are subject to Part VI. Part VI was enacted to deal with the \nheightened privacy concerns engaged by the police act of “intercepting” private \ncommunications ( TELUS , at paras. 23 -24). Installing a separate device is simply one \nmethod of executing an intercept.  \n[272]  When discussing non -participant surveillance,  this Court said in  R. v. \nJones , 2017 SCC 60, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 696,  that an “interception relates to actions by \nwhich a third party interjects itself into the communication process in real -time through \ntechnological means” (para. 72, cited in Jamal J.’s reasons, at para.  96). Notably absent \nin Jones is any pronouncement on the need for a separate device in all cases. This \nstatement was responsive to the facts before the Court in Jones and, in our view, applies \nto the circumstances of this case. The police here used text messages (actions) to \ninterject themselves into the communication process between Mr. Campbell and \nMr. Gammie in real time through the use of a cell phone (technological mean s). \nAdditionally, those technological means produced a record of the conversation.  \n[273]  While the relevant Criminal Code  provisions are “laws that were a product \nof the 1970s”, in TELUS  this Court stated that Part VI must be interpreted in light of \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n \n s. 8 of the  Charter , “which in turn must remain aligned with technological \ndevelopments” (paras. 33 and 53, citing R. v. Wong , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, at p.  44; \nBykovets , at para. 11). The clear message is that emerging police investigatory \ntechniques must adapt in a man ner that accords with Charter  rights. Often the need for \nnew techniques arises precisely because there has been a technological innovation that \nrequires an inventive response in the public interest. In this case, the technological \ndevelopment is how a cell  phone allows both text and voice conversations and \nautomatically creates a record of text messages sent and received. The manner in which \nsuch a device can now operate therefore leads to new ways in which conversations can \nbe recorded or acquired under s.  183 of the Criminal Code . In Jones , this Court \ncautioned courts to be “alert to .  . . modern methods of electronic surveillance” as the \nstate may be “tempted to embark on forward -looking, ‘fishing expedition[s] in the hope \nof uncovering evidence of crime’” (para. 74, quoting Wong , at p. 47 , and R. v. Finlay  \n(1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Ont. C.A.), at p.  70). \n[274]  From a normative privacy perspective, there is also no meaningful \ndistinction between  the recording of a private phone call conversation by police and a \ntext message exchange of that same  conversation which creates its own record . Private \nconversations should not attract diminished privacy protections from the state merely \nbecause a separate police -initiated device is not being used to record it. Such an \ninterpretation ignores the purpose behind Part VI, which was enacted precisely to \nprotect against “unauthorized intrusions upon our privacy by the agents of the state, \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n \n whatever technical form the means of invasion may take ” (TELUS , at para. 33 \n(emphasis added), quoting Wong , at p.  44). \n[275]  It is obvious that if the police’s conversation with Mr. Campbell took place",

However, we do not \naccept that wh en, in the present circumstances, the same conversation took place over \na medium known to create its own record there is somehow a lesser level of state \nintrusion into privacy rights and no authorization was necessary. With respect, this \noverly rigid appro ach makes little sense, provides undersized protections to privacy \nrights, and ignores how frequently personal, private conversations now take place using \ntext messaging rather than traditional telephone calls.  \n[276]  No reliance should be placed on the Court of  Appeal of Alberta’s decision \nin R. v. Beairsto , 2018 ABCA 118, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 207, to support the proposition \nthat there was no interception in this case. First, the trial judge in that case relied on an \nunduly restrictive interpretation of this Cour t’s holding from Duarte  as being concerned \nonly with a “recording” of private communications, rather than on the state’s ability to \naccess what was intended to be a private conversation between private citizens ( R. v. \nBeairsto , 2016 ABQB 216, 37 Alta. L.R.  (6th) 379, at paras. 59 -61; Duarte , at pp.  43-\n44; Penney, at p. 23). Second, the trial judge recycled the same type of risk -assumption \nanalysis that was rejected in Duarte . Finally, the Court of Appeal in Beairsto  relied \nexclusively on the decision of the  Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador in \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n \n R. v. Mills , 2017 NLCA 12, 1 C.A.N.L.R. 488, to support the proposition that deception \ndoes not amount to interception (para. 25). However, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning \nin Mills  largely relied on the invo lvement of a third party to constitute an intercept \n(paras. 13 -14). An “interception” does not require a third party in cases of participant \nsurveillance ( Mills  (SCC), at para. 139, per Martin J.).  \n[277]  While we do not endorse Jamal J.’s conclusion that this c ould not be an \ninterception requiring a Part VI authorization, in the absence of full argument on and \nthe benefit of the Court of Appeal’s consideration of the proper authorizing provision, \nthis Court lacks the requisite basis to pronounce conclusively on which statutory \nprovision would permit a court to authorize this conduct. We therefore prefer to leave \nthis issue for another day. However, under either Part VI or s. 487.01 of the Criminal \nCode , Parliament has signalled that police must adhere to more rig orous standards in \norder to obtain evidence by “intercepting” private communications, or using novel \ntechniques that are not otherwise provided for in the Criminal Code  (see the statutory \nrequirements for urgent intercepts in ss. 184.4 and 188, and the gen eral warrant in \ns. 487.01(1)). As the trial judge’s findings in this case do not meet the legal standard \nfor exigency justifying a warrantless search under s. 11(7) of the CDSA , it is preferable \nthat the determination of the proper authorizing provision be  based on full and thorough \nargument.  \n[278]  Regardless of the precise Criminal Code provision required to authorize \nthe police’s chosen investigatory technique, we are left with a search for which no \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n \n warrant was obtained. As Hunter  made perfectly clear, a warran tless search is prima \nfacie unreasonable (p. 161).

In order for the Crown to discharge its onus to demonstrate \nthat a warrantless search is nonetheless reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 of the \nCharter , it must establish that the search is authorized by  law, and that both the \nauthorizing law and manner in which the search is conducted are reasonable ( R. v. \nCollins , [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at pp. 277 -78; R. v. Tim , 2022 SCC 12, [2022] 1 S.C.R. \n234, at paras. 45 -46). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this search was not \nreasonable: it was not a search incident to arrest and the lack of imminent harm means \nthere were no exigent circumstances.  \nC. The Investigative Technique Was Not a Search Incident to Arrest  \n[279]  We agree with Jamal J. that the police off icer’s communications with the \nappellant do not fall within the scope of a search incident to arrest because the police \ndid not conduct it for a valid law enforcement purpose connected or related to the \nreasons for the arrest. The framework set out in R. v. Fearon , 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 \nS.C.R. 621, which narrowly constrains this power, does not authorize police to use a \nlawfully seized cell phone to communicate with another person as a part of the power \nto search incident to arrest. Several portions of the Fearon decision suggest that the \nCourt’s analysis is limited to a consideration of police accessing or viewing existing \ncontent, and it does not extend to all of the ways in which a police officer might use or \nsearch a cell phone (see  para.  76).   \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 152 ---\n \n [280]  In the c ase before us, while the police arrested Mr. Gammie for drug \ntrafficking, that arrest was not tied to the impending drug transaction with \nMr. Campbell. This transaction constituted a distinct potential offence. The police only \nbecame aware of it after read ing the first four messages on Mr. Gammie’s phone while \nhe was under arrest. Thus, a probe into a separate potential offence committed by \nanother person cannot be truly incidental to the reasons for Mr. Gammie’s arrest.  \nD. The Actions Taken by the Police Were  Not Justified by the Exigent Circumstances \nDoctrine  \n[281]  We turn to the Crown’s argument that the police’s warrantless search was \nnonetheless reasonable because it involved exigent circumstances. “Exigent \ncircumstances” has been described as “a test to be app lied to determine the justification \nfor a warrantless search” ( Fontana and Keeshan, at p. 1753).  Where a warrantless \nsearch falls within the proper scope of the exigent circumstances doctrine and is \nconducted in a reasonable manner, it may comply with s. 8  of the Charter  (R. v. Tse , \n2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, at para. 18; R. v. Grant , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223 \n(“Grant 1993”), at p. 250).  \n[282]  In the courts below, this issue was considered under s. 11(7) of the CDSA  \n(voir dire  reasons, at paras. 98 -100; C.A. re asons, at paras. 77 -80). In our view, whether \nor not this investigative technique could have been authorized by s. 11 of the CDSA , \nwe are persuaded that Mr. Campbell’s s. 8 rights were breached in any event as the \nfacts found by the trial judge did not, in  law, amount to exigent circumstances. \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n \n Section  11(7) involves a lower standard than required under more rigorous authorities \npermitting warrantless acquisition of real -time communications. Even assuming the \npolice conduct could fall within the warrantless search powers under s. 11(7), the \ncircumstances of this case extend well beyond the recognized safety branch of the \ndoctrine of exigent circumstances.  \n[283]  To explain this conclusion, we briefly address the appropriate standard of \nreview, canvass the origins a nd scope of the doctrine of exigent",

Even assuming the \npolice conduct could fall within the warrantless search powers under s. 11(7), the \ncircumstances of this case extend well beyond the recognized safety branch of the \ndoctrine of exigent circumstances.  \n[283]  To explain this conclusion, we briefly address the appropriate standard of \nreview, canvass the origins a nd scope of the doctrine of exigent circumstances, and \nestablish why it was not correctly applied in this case.  \n(1) Exigent Circumstances Involves the Application of a Legal Standard to the \nFacts of the Case  \n[284]  We agree with our colleague Jamal J. that whether t he factual findings in \nthis case meet the requirements of the exigent circumstances doctrine is a question of \nlaw ( R. v. Shepherd , 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20). Factual matters \nrelating to what occurred, and the basis for the police’s bel ief that urgent warrantless \naction was required, are indeed “grounded in the factual findings of the trial judge” \nreviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error ( ibid.; see also para. 18). \nHowever, the question of whether those facts amount, at law, to exigent circumstances \nrendering a warrantless search reasonable under s. 8 of the Charter involves “the \napplication of a legal standard to the facts of the case” (para.  20).   \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n \n [285]  The appellant argues that the Court of Appeal applied the wrong standard  \nof review when it considered whether the trial judge’s findings of fact legally \n“amounted to exigent circumstances” (para. 83). We agree. Consistent with Shepherd , \nthe task of the reviewing court was to determine whether the facts found by the trial \njudge  met the legal standard of exigent circumstances set out in statute and the \njurisprudence. With respect, the Court of Appeal erroneously focused on whether the \ntrial judge’s factual findings regarding the claimed urgency of the situation and \nimpracticabili ty were “unreasonable” or were “unduly speculative” or “open to [him] \nto make” (paras. 83 -84). The Court of Appeal failed to consider whether, at law, the \nfacts as found met the legal standard for exigent circumstances. As we explain, the \ncircumstances of this case did not rise to the type of imminent safety risk that \nconstitutes exigent circumstances at law.  \n(2) The Origins of the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine  \n[286]  “Exigent circumstances” as a legal term has its roots in American \njurisprudence (Fontana and Keeshan, at p. 1753; W. F. Foster and J. E. Magnet, “The \nLaw of Forcible Entry” (1977), 15 Alta. L. Rev.  271, at p. 289; see Kentucky v. King , \n563 U.S. 452 (2011)) . However, the notion of an exceptional power to conduct a search \nor seizure without a warrant in extenuating circumstances has a distinct history under \nthe Anglo -Canadian common law. As history demonstrates, such powers have \nconsistently been construed na rrowly. Indeed, the doctrine of exigent circumstances \ncannot be understood separate from the longstanding normative approach of the law of \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 155 ---\n \n search and seizure that, whenever feasible, intrusions upon property, privacy and \ndignity, should be authorized in ad vance. Of particular relevance to this appeal is how, \nsince the adoption of the Charter , this Court has consistently taken a careful and narrow \napproach to the doctrine of exigent circumstances.   \n[287]  Exceptional powers reserved for urgent circumstances emerged in the \ncontext of the common law’s focus on protecting individuals against unjustified \nintrusions onto private property. Historically, at common law there was no power to \nenter private property and search without legal authority under a warrant, ex cept \nincident to arrest ( R. v. Rao  (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 110 and 120; \nColet v. The Queen , [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 8 -9; Hunter , at p. 160;  Entick v. \nCarrington ",

The Queen , [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 8 -9; Hunter , at p. 160;  Entick v. \nCarrington  (1765), 2 Wils. K.B. 275, 95 E.R. 807 , at pp. 817 -18; Fontana and Keesh an, \nat pp. 1149 -50).  \n[288]  The phrase “exigent circumstances” appeared for the first time in this \nCourt’s jurisprudence in Eccles v. Bourque , [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, an action in trespass. \nAt issue in Eccles  was whether police officers were authorized to enter a p rivate \napartment to apprehend the subject of three arrest warrants. The Court affirmed both \n“the basic principle” established in Semayne’s Case  (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 77 E.R. \n194, at p.  195, that “the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortres s”, as well \nas a limitation on that principle that entry may exceptionally be permitted in the public \ninterest to execute criminal process, such as in search of a fugitive ( Eccles , at \npp. 742-43).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n \n [289]  The Court nevertheless also clarified that the power to en ter private \nproperty to execute a warrant was not unrestricted: police were required to have \nreasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person sought was within the \npremises; and “ [e]xcept in exigent circumstances , the police officers must make an  \nannouncement prior to entry” (pp. 745 -47 (emphasis added)). Eccles  thus affirmed the \n“knock and announce” rule — a principle that gives weight to property, privacy, and \ndignity interests ( R. v. Cornell , 2010 SCC 31, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 142, at para. 19) — while \nacknowledging the possibility of exceptions based on exigency.  \n[290]  No exigent circumstances existed in Eccles , and  the Court made a summary \nreference to situations where entry without notice could be justified: “.  . . there will be \noccasions on which, for e xample, to save someone within the premises from death or \ninjury  or to prevent destruction of evidence  or if in hot pursuit  notice may not be \nrequired” (p. 747 (emphasis added)).  \n[291]  The hot pursuit exception to the sanctity of the home is well established at  \ncommon law and has survived the requirement established by this Court in R. v. Feeney , \n[1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, that police have  a warrant to enter a home to execute an arrest \n(paras.  47 and 51; Semayne’s Case , at p. 198;  R. v. Macooh , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 802, at \npp. 813 -15). In Macooh , the Court defined hot pursuit, noting that “the essence of fresh \npursuit is that it must be continuous pursuit conducted with reasonable diligence, so \nthat pursuit and capture along with the commission of the offence may be consider ed \nas forming part of a single transaction” (p. 817, citing R. E.  Salhany, Canadian \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 157 ---\n \n Criminal Procedure  (5th ed. 1989), at p. 44). With fresh knowledge of the commission \nof an offence, police could therefore lawfully pursue the suspect and enter into a home  \nto ensure an offender could not evade justice by simply retreating into their home \n(Macooh , at pp. 815 -16). \n[292]  The scenarios envisioned in these examples necessarily involve \nconsequences that would unfold in close temporal nexus to the police action — that i s, \nimmediately or very soon after. If the consequences were distant from the immediate \nsituation, there would be no need or basis for a sudden entry into a home.

There are \ntherefore two temporal aspects of exigent circumstances that emerge from these \nexamp les: first, the police action is required immediately; second, the police action is \nnecessary because the specified harm will occur imminently. Without imminent  harm, \nthe need for immediate warrantless police action vanishes.  \n(3) The Evolution of Exigent Circu mstances Post -Charter   \n[293]  The advent of the Charter required the Court to grapple with how the \ndoctrine of exigent circumstances would fit into a constitutional framework placing a \nstronger emphasis on providing protections to privacy interests. In a number o f \nsignificant decisions, discussed below, this Court was careful to articulate exigent \ncircumstances as narrow exceptions to the rule that warrantless searches are prima facie \nunreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter . Following those decisions, Parliament en acted \nstatutory provisions permitting warrantless entries or searches in exigent \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 158 ---\n \n circumstances, capturing principles set down in the cases and in some instances adding \nto them.  \n(a) Early Cases: Recognition of a Narrow Exception and Statutory \nAmendments  \n[294]  This Co urt’s pivotal decision in Hunter established the framework for how \nwarrantless searches in exigent circumstances should be examined. Hunter recognized \nthat the purpose of s. 8 of the Charter  was “to protect individuals from unjustified state \nintrusions upon their privacy”, to be accomplished by a system of prior judicial \nauthorization ( pp. 157 -58 and 160 -61). While not dealing expressly with exigent \ncircumstances, Dickson J. (as he was then) recognized that “it may not be reasonable \nin every instance to insist on prior authorization in order to validate governmental \nintrusions upon individuals’ expectations of privacy”, but nevertheless required that, \n“where it is feasible  to obtain prior auth orization, I would hold that such authorization \nis a precondition for a valid search and seizure” (p. 161 (emphasis added)).  \n[295]  A focused analysis of exigent circumstances was not undertaken until \nGrant 1993, where the Court considered the legality of warrant less searches of the \nperimeter of a home pursuant to s. 10 of the Narcotic Control Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. N‑1. \nSection 10 allowed police to conduct warrantless searches of places other than a \ndwelling -house based on reasonable grounds. The Court read the pro vision down, \nholding that it was in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and inoperable to the extent that \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 159 ---\n \n it purported to authorize a warrantless search absent exigent circumstances in which it \nwas impracticable — that is, not feasible — to obtain a warrant ( pp. 228 and 243 -44).  \n[296]  Writing on behalf of the Court, Sopinka J. observed that deviations from \nHunter standards would be rare, but acknowledged the need to balance the societal \ninterest in law enforcement (pp. 240 -41). The Court emphasized that this except ion to \nthe general rule proscribing warrantless searches was to be “narrowly construed” \n(p. 241):  \nIn general, the test will only be satisfied where there exists an imminent \ndanger of the loss, removal, destruction or disappearance of the evidence \nsought in  a narcotics investigation if the search or seizure is delayed in \norder to obtain a warrant. [pp.  241-42] \n[297]  The Court thus recognized a narrow exigent circumstances exception for \nnarcotics investigations. It also declined to recognize a blanket exception for  the \npresence of narcotics on a moving conveyance, concluding that it would depend on the \nfacts of each case (p. 242).  \n[298]  Two years later, this Court held in R. v. Silveira , [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297, that \na warrantless entry into a home for the purpose of preserv ing evidence pending the \nissuance of a search warrant breached s. 8 of the Charter . The Crown had conceded \nthat the entry and securing of the premises violated s. 8 of the Charter  (at para. 140), \nand the main issue was whether the",

The Crown had conceded \nthat the entry and securing of the premises violated s. 8 of the Charter  (at para. 140), \nand the main issue was whether the evidence should be exclud ed under s. 24(2) of the \nCharter .  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 160 ---\n \n [299]  Both the majority and La Forest J. in dissent concluded that the breach \narose from the police’s entry into the home in direct contravention of s. 10 of the \nNarcotic Control Act , which only permitted warranted entry into a  dwelling -house \n(paras. 41, 49 and 141 -42). L’Heureux‐Dubé J., concurring in the result and writing \nalone, concluded there was no breach of s. 8 on the basis that a general “common law \nexception of exigent circumstances” existed despite the statutory warra nt requirement \n(para. 105).  \n[300]  Despite the majority’s conclusion that this was a very serious breach, the \nCourt upheld the decision of the courts below to admit the evidence under s. 24(2). \nWriting for the majority, Cory J. accepted the trial judge’s finding s that arrests that had \noccurred publicly in the neighbourhood and the need to preserve evidence constituted \nexigent circumstances mitigating the seriousness of the breach (paras. 150 -51).  \n[301]  A final significant case from this period is Feeney , in which this  Court \nreconsidered the common law in Eccles and R. v. Landry , [1986] 1 S.C.R. 145, on \nwarrantless arrest following a forced entry into private premises. The facts in Feeney \nunfolded in the aftermath of a violent crime. After an elderly man was violently b eaten \nto death in his home with an iron bar or similar object, the police acted on tips and \nentered the accused’s dwelling, detained him, and subsequently arrested him after \nseeing blood on his shirt. Observing that the common law had to be “adjusted to \ncomport with Charter values” (para. 42), Sopinka J. confirmed for the majority that, \ngenerally, both an arrest warrant and a warrant authorizing entry into a home would be \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 161 ---\n \n required to effect an arrest therein, reflecting the greater weight of privacy interes ts in \nthe post -Charter era (paras. 42 -45 and 48 -51). \n[302]  Significantly, the majority again declined to recognize a general exigent \ncircumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Sopinka J. accepted that there \nshould be an exception for hot pursuit, but ch ose to “leave for another day” whether \nexigent circumstances other than hot pursuit could justify warrantless entry to arrest in \na home (para. 47). He disagreed with L’Heureux‐Dubé J.’s conclusion, in dissent, that \n“exigent circumstances generally necessar ily justify a warrantless entry”, and \nconsidered it an open question ( ibid. (emphasis in original)).  \n[303]  The decisions in Silveira and Feeney  prompted legislative action. \nParliament amended the Criminal Code  and the CDSA  (which replaced the repealed \nNarcotic Control Act ) to allow warrantless searches in exigent circumstances. Section \n487.11 of the Criminal Code allows police to “exercise any of the powers described in \nsubsection 487(1) or 492.1(1)” — the standard search warrant and tracking warrant \nprovisions,  respectively — “without a warrant if the conditions for obtaining a warrant \nexist but by reason of exigent circumstances it would be impracticable to obtain a \nwarrant”. Unlike the Narcotic Control Act , the CDSA no longer distinguishes between \ndwelling -houses and other places in authorizing searches by police. Using language \nsimilar to s.  487.11 of the Criminal Code , s. 11(7) of the CDSA  allows police to search \n“a place” without a warrant in exigent circumstances for any prohibited controlled \nsubstance, pre cursor, offence -related property, or thing that will afford evidence of an \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 162 ---\n \n",

Neither s. 487.11 of the Criminal Code nor s. 11(7) of the CDSA \nprovide a definition of exigent circumstances.  \n[304]  Following Feeney , Parliament enacted a statuto ry regime for judicial \npre-authorization of entry into a dwelling -house to effect arrests (see Hutchison et al., \nat § 3:23). Included in the amendments to the Criminal Code was s. 529.3, which \npermitted warrantless entry in exigent circumstances. Unlike s. 487.11 of the Criminal \nCode and s. 11(7) of the CDSA , s. 529.3(2) defined exigent circumstances as including \ncircumstances in which the officer:  \n(a) has reasonable grounds  to suspect that entry into the dwelling -house is \nnecessary to prevent imminent bodily harm or death to any person; or  \n \n(b) has reasonable grounds to believe that evidence relating to the \ncommission of an indictable offence is present in the dwelling -house  and \nthat entry into the dwelling -house is necessary to prevent the imminent loss \nor imminent destruction of the evidence.  \n[305]  Section 529.3 does not limit any other authority that might permit \nwarrantless entry into a dwelling -house, such as hot pursuit, open ing with the words: \n“[w]ithout limiting or restricting any power a peace officer may have to enter a \ndwelling -house under this or any other Act or law.  . . .” Additional statutory powers to \nsearch in exigent circumstances are found in s. 117.02 (search and  seizure in relation \nto weapons and firearm offences) and s. 184.4 (emergency wiretap to prevent serious \nharm; see Tse). \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 163 ---\n \n [306]  What we take from this Court’s jurisprudence in the years after the Charter \nwas first enacted, leading to partial codification, is that “exigent circumstances” is a \ndetermination to be made with care. It is a narrow power to be used in extraordinary \ncircumstances (see R. v. Kelsy , 2011 ONCA 605, 280 C.C.C. (3d) 456, at para. 35) t hat \nallows for s. 8’s default requirement of prior judicial authorization to be dispensed with. \nA serious crime is not enough to establish exigency under a s. 8 analysis ( Feeney , at \nparas. 52 -53) — whether exigent circumstances exist must be determined acc ording to \nthe parameters of the law. Where individual privacy interests are higher, such as in a \nhome, the Court has delineated specific situations where exigency could justify \nintrusion in a given case, declining to recognize a general common law power. W e \nwould approach privacy interests in electronic devices with similar care.  \n(b) More Recent Articulation of Requirements Under the Exigent \nCircumstances Doctrine  \n[307]  Since Parliament codified certain warrantless powers to search in exigent \ncircumstances, and despi te the absence of a statutory definition in s. 11(7) of the CDSA  \nand s. 487.11 of the Criminal Code , the requirements for establishing exigent \ncircumstances are clear. Commentators have noted that this Court has been faithful to \nthe Hunter framework in its  consideration of police powers to search in exigent \ncircumstances ( T. Quigley, “The Impact of the Charter on the Law of Search and \nSeizure” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R.  (2d) 117, at pp. 130 and 138; R. Jochelson and D.

Professor Jochelson and Professor Ireland (writing extra -judicially \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 164 ---\n \n before his appointment to the bench) suggest that this may be because the “concept of \nexigence is clear and limited in t he common law” and Parliament has legislated in the \narea (p. 134).  \n[308]  The requirements set out in statute and case law for a warrantless search to \nbe justified by reason of exigent circumstances may be distilled into three required \nelements: the existence of grounds for obtaining a warrant; the existence of exigent \ncircumstances; and whether those exigent circumstances rendered it impracticable for \nthe police to obtain a warrant ( CDSA , s. 11(7); Criminal Code , s. 487.11; R. v. Paterson , \n2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S .C.R. 202, at paras. 28 and 32 -37; Grant 1993, at pp. 241 -43; \nKelsy , at paras.  24-35; Fontana and Keeshan, at pp. 1753 -55). \n[309]  In Paterson , Brown J., for the majority, rejected Mr. Paterson’s invitation \nto the Court to import the definition of “exigent circum stances” found in s. 529.3(2) of \nthe Criminal Code  into “exigent circumstances” as it appears in s. 11(7) of the CDSA  \n(para. 30). This argument was rejected based on the absence of express language in \ns. 11 that defined exigent circumstances in the same ma nner as s. 529.3(2) (para. 31). \nAs a matter of statutory interpretation, Brown J. concluded that there was “no good \nreason to believe that Parliament intended the definition of ‘exigent circumstances’ in \ns. 529.3(2) of the Criminal Code  to be read into s. 11(7) of the CDSA ” (ibid.). On this \nbasis alone, he declined to “do by ‘interpretation’ what Parliament chose not to do by \nenactment” ( ibid., quoting Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. SODRAC 2003 Inc. , 2015 \nSCC 57, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 615, at para. 53).   \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 165 ---\n \n [310]  After rejecting this argument based on settled principles of statutory \ninterpretation, Brown J. summarized the jurisprudence recognizing the main categories \nof exigency as loss or destruction of evidence, officer or public safety, and hot pursuit. \nBrown J. concl uded that the “common theme” emerging from descriptions of exigent \ncircumstances in the cases was one of “ urgency , arising from circumstances calling for \nimmediate police action to preserve evidence, officer safety or public safety” and “not \nmerely conveni ence, propitiousness or economy” ( Paterson , at paras. 32 -33 (emphasis \nin original)). Reading Paterson  as a whole and in context, by describing the common \ntheme emerging from the cases in this way, Brown J. was not setting out a new test or \naltering the sta ndards required to establish exigency in established categories. He \npointed to the Court’s jurisprudence which has over the years clarified these \nrequirements.  \n[311]  With respect to concerns about evidence, Brown J. endorsed the standard \nset out by the Court in  Grant  1993  as “imminent danger of the loss, removal, \ndestruction or disappearance of the evidence if the search or seizure is delayed” \n(para.  32, quoting Grant  1993, at p. 243). This language was mirrored by Doherty J.A. \nin R. v. Hobeika , 2020 ONCA 750, 1 53 O.R. (3d) 350, when setting out the applicable \nlegal standard: “The urgency component of s. 11(7), as described  in Paterson , was \nmade out if .  . . the police have reasonable grounds to believe there was an imminent \nrisk that evidence in the unit would b e destroyed before the police could obtain and \nexecute",

Accordingly, the governing \nstandard from Grant 1993, as described in Paterson , still applied.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 166 ---\n \n [312]  The safety branch of exigent circumstances was accepted by the courts \nbelow as the basis for the warrantless search in this case (C.A. reasons, at para. 83). As \nRosenberg J.A. observed in  Kelsy , the jurisprudence related to safety searches has \ndeveloped largely in relation to the common law ancillary powers doctri ne (para. 58). \nSafety has also been considered in the context of search incident to arrest.  \n[313]  We observe that in cases related to safety, there are strict temporal \nconstraints, as immediate action is needed to address imminent harm to safety. The \npotential volatility surrounding an arrest or 911 call gives rise to safety concerns that \nare tightly circumscribed to the time period of the arrest or emergency. For example in \nR. v. MacDonald , 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37 , cited by this Court at para.  32 of \nPaterson in the safety category, the Court found that the Waterfield  doctrine ( R. v. \nWaterfield , [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.)) justified a police officer’s conduct when \nresponding to a noise complaint. The officer pushed open the accused’s partially \nopened d oor after seeing something “black and shiny” in his hand, which turned out to \nbe a loaded gun ( MacDonald , at paras. 6 -8). Paterson , at para. 32,  also cited the \nstatement in MacDonald , at para. 32, that searches to preserve officer safety will be \nresponsive  to “dangerous situations created by individuals, to which the police must \nreact ‘on the sudden’”.  \n[314]  This language echoes the comments of Doherty J.A. in R. v. Golub  (1997), \n34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), that where immediate action is required to secure the safety \nof those at the scene of an arrest in potentially dangerous situations, “a search \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 167 ---\n \n conducted in a manner which is consistent with the preservation of the safety o f those \nat the scene is justified” (p. 758).   \n[315]  This Court has also cited  R. v. Godoy , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, as an example \nof exigent circumstances ( Tse, at para. 18), where the issue was whether the Charter \nprecluded warrantless entry and search in respondi ng to emergency 911 calls. The \nCourt concluded that “the importance of the police duty to protect life warrants and \njustifies a forced entry into a dwelling in order to ascertain the health and safety of a \n911 caller”, but emphasized that “the intrusion mu st be limited to the protection of life \nand safety”, providing police only with “authority to investigate the 911 call and, in \nparticular, to locate the caller and determine his or her reasons for making the call and \nprovide such assistance as may be requi red” ( Godoy , at para. 22).  \n[316]  In Tse, this Court considered the constitutionality of the emergency wiretap \nprovision, and concluded that this warrantless authority is only available on an urgent \nbasis to prevent harm that is both serious and imminent, subject  to “strict inherent time \nrestrictions” (para. 27).  \n[317]  Feeney also instructs that a safety risk must be specific, exceptional, and \nconcrete (paras. 52 -53). The majority rejected the notion that a general risk from a \ndangerous person being on the loose would suffice, finding that “[t]o define these as \nexigent circumstances is to invite such a characterization of every period after a serious \ncrime” (para. 53).

Likewise, in L’Espérance v. R. , 2011 QCCA 237, the Court of \nAppeal of Quebec rejected the notion that exigent circumstances could be established \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 168 ---\n \n given that [ TRANSLATION ] “safety concerns are often present in drug cases ” (para. 31 \n(emphasis in original)).  \n[318]  Accordingly, while the safety branch is “non -controversial” as the societal \ninterest in protection of h uman life is strong (R.  M. Pomerance, “Parliament’s \nResponse to R. v. Feeney: A New Regime for Entry and Arrest in Dwelling Houses” \n(1998), 13 C.R. (5th) 84, at p. 92), it has only been applied to override the requirement \nfor prior authorization where the safety interest is sufficiently compelling — that is, \nwhere the threat to safety is imminent, clear, and concrete. In our view, the \njurisprudence supports a narrow and strict application of the safety branch, or indeed \nany category of exigent circumstances , in order for the warrantless search under \nscrutiny to be constitutionally compliant.  \n(4) The Warrantless Investigative Technique in This Case Was Not Justified \nby the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine  \n[319]  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the warrantl ess investigative \ntechnique used by police in this case breached Mr. Campbell’s s. 8 Charter rights. In \nour view, the search in this case could not be authorized by s. 11(7) of the CDSA \nbecause there was no imminent safety risk that compelled the police to  take immediate \nand warrantless action.  \n(a) The Circumstances of This Case Do Not Fall Within the Safety Branch  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n \n [320]  The trial judge’s conclusions on the issue of exigent circumstances, relying \non Paterson , are found in the voir dire  reasons, at paras. 100 -101: \n On this authority, I find that there were exigent circumstances in this \ncase. Without immediate action, the transaction and the drugs were at risk.  \nThe texts show that “Dew” was already impatient. At that time of day, only \na telewarrant would have been ava ilable, but in any event it would likely \narrive too late to complete this transaction . The likelihood that the \ntransaction involved fentanyl and its dramatic effects on the community \nmakes this a matter of public safety.  \n \n Accordingly, it was open to the o fficers to search the phone to the extent \nof entering into the conversation with Mr. Campbell. [Emphasis added.]  \n[321]  As the Court of Appeal identified, the police’s public safety concern \ndepended on separate transactions unfolding in the future — first Mr. Cam pbell would \nbe required to sell the half ounce of heroin “to someone else at another time”, and \nsubsequently, the drugs would be sold to others, “ultimately reaching users on the \nstreet” (para. 83). The harm envisaged depended upon these two events materia lizing \nat some point.  \n[322]  The safety concern articulated does not meet the legal standard for exigent \ncircumstances: it cannot be characterized as imminent on a plain understanding of that \nword and it is unsupported by the jurisprudence.  \n[323]  Society’s interest i n public safety is relevant to numerous areas of criminal \nlaw and Charter jurisprudence. Assessing whether a particular safety concern is legally \nrelevant to the application of the exigent circumstances doctrine is distinct from \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 170 ---\n \n consideration of community safety in the sentencing context. The former requires \ncourts to assess whether a specific safety concern was so pressing and fast approaching \nthat it justified bypassing the default s. 8 requirement of prior, judicial authorization. \nAdvancing public safety  is also a goal of sentencing law, and in that context courts \naddress safety concerns as societal ills implicated in the case before them ( R. v. \nParranto , 2021 SCC 46, [2021] 3",

In sentencing an offender, courts consider public safety interests \nalongside the particular circumstances of a case to tailor an appropriate sentence ( R. v. \nJones , [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, at pp. 288 -90; R. v. Hilbach , 2023 SCC 3, at para. 92). The \nCourt of Appeal’s reliance on this Court’s decision in Parranto to establish the factual \nunderpinnings of the safety risk in this case is consequently misplaced (C.A. reasons,  \nat para. 83). Moreover, Parranto considered the appropriate sentence for individuals \ninvolved in commercial wholesale fentanyl trafficking operations, which is different \nthan the situation in this case (para. 2).  \n[324]  In the application of the doctrine of exi gent circumstances, a generalized, \nsocietal safety concern cannot be sufficient to justify warrantless action unless it poses \nan imminent threat.  As Martin J.A. observed in R. v. Noble  (1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 146 \n(Ont. C.A.), setting the standard for exigen t circumstances too low presents a danger \nof the exception consuming the general rule requiring a warrant ( p. 171) .  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 171 ---\n \n [325]  The potential risk of harm that might arise from an individual’s use of a \ndrug after intervening events is inconsistent with the types of i mminent safety risks that \ncourts have recognized as exigent. As described above, imminent safety risks are those \nthat may occur so quickly that immediate action is required, such as in cases requiring \na rapid forced entry to ensure the life and safety of t hose within, or where there is the \npossibility that a sudden move in a volatile situation could be a threat to the safety of a \npolice officer. Such a notion of imminence has been consistently applied in the key \ncases described above, as well as in other de cisions of appellate courts (see R. v. \nLaliberte , 2007 SKCA 7, 289 Sask.  R. 253; R. v. Bakal , 2021 ONCA 584, 157 O.R. \n(3d) 401; R. v. Shomonov , 2019 ONCA 1008). The authors of Drug Offences in Canada  \nprovide the example of the police having grounds to beli eve “that there are volatile and \ndangerous chemicals in a drug production lab” as one possible “safety” search that may \nrelate to a drug offence ( § 25:35).  \n[326]  We reject the view that the police’s belief that, because the relevant drugs \nwere “at risk” without  their intervention, s. 11(7)’s threshold for urgency was met \n(Jamal J.’s reasons, at paras. 118 -24). The claimed need to interrupt an impending drug \ndeal of this amount and type of drug did not arise from or result in a fast approaching \ndanger to public s afety. The situation  lacked “ urgency , arising from circumstances \ncalling for immediate police action to preserve evidence, officer safety or public safety” \n(Paterson , at para. 33 (emphasis in original)). In other words, it falls within the category \nor cond uct Brown J. labelled as mere “convenience, propitiousness or economy” \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 172 ---\n \n (ibid.).

There is no evidence of another prospective buyer \nimmediately waiting in the wings, making the potential sale imminent. The evidence \nwas that one police officer be lieved that the transaction was going to occur in the “near \nfuture”, while another agreed that there was nothing in the text messages that indicated \nthat the transaction was going to happen immediately (A.R., part V , vol. I, at pp.  184 \nand 240 -41). This do es not meet the legal threshold for imminence. We accept that the \npolice were not aware of Dew before they saw the four messages on the screen of \nMr. Gammie’s phone and made investigative decisions in response to an unexpected \nsituation. However, that situ ation did not justify warrantless police action because it \ndid not meet the required legal standard necessary to comply with s. 8. Under the aegis \nof the safety branch of the exigent circumstances doctrine, it is the risk of harm from \nsafety threats that m ust be imminent to necessitate warrantless action. In our view, the \nfactual findings of the trial judge did not reach the legal standard of exigency to justify \na warrantless search under s. 8 of the Charter .  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 173 ---\n \n [328]  The general desire to keep drugs off the street  and out of the hands of \npotential users will properly be common to all police investigations involving \ndangerous substances. Certain drugs, like the fentanyl found in the heroin sold in this \ncase, produce tragic consequences  for individuals and communities in Canada. This \ncomplex societal problem requires a  multifaceted response. However, stretching the \nexigent circumstances doctrine beyond what has previously, and can credibly, qualify \nas imminent harm opens the door to warr antless searches almost anytime police have \nan opportunity to seize drugs or whenever a potentially serious offence is being \ninvestigated. To paraphrase Feeney , to define these as exigent circumstances is to invite \nsuch a characterization whenever a potent ial drug transaction involves a dangerous \nsubstance regardless of the absence of imminent harm (see para. 53). This wrongly \nelevates the appropriate and ever -present concern over public safety into exigent \ncircumstances because of the health risks associat ed with the use of unregulated illicit \ndrugs. The result will be to authorize invasive and extensive police conduct outside of \nthose rare instances in which the harm to public safety is so imminent and immediate, \na prima facie  unreasonable warrantless sear ch is judged to be reasonable.  \n[329]  Not only does this approach run afoul of the requirement in Feeney that the  \nrisk must be specific, exceptional, and concrete, it also allows the exception to swallow \nthe rule in the manner Martin J.A. warned against in Noble , at p. 171 . It waters  down \nthe statutory regimes Parliament has enacted to regulate and restrict warrantless \nsearches, and the protection of s. 8, which is both embodied in those regimes and exists \nindependently of them.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 174 ---\n \n (b) In the Absence of Exigency, the Re quirement of Impracticability Is Not \nEstablished  \n[330]  The legal requirement of impracticability received little consideration in \nthis case.

Rather, \nthe exigency “must be shown to cause  impracticability” (para. 34 (emphasis added)). \nIn this case, it would be necessary to show that an imminent safety risk rendered it \nimpracticable to obtain a warrant  before taking steps to ensure that the risk did not \nmaterialize. Respectfully, the Court of Appeal erroneously failed to consider whether \nthe trial judge’s finding that immediate action was required met the requisite legal \nstandard for exigency and imprac ticability. It simply concluded that the finding was \n“open to the trial judge to make” (para. 84).  \n[331]  As we have concluded, the circumstances of a potential, sometime \nsubsequent sale of a small quantity of a dangerous drug that would likely later reach \nusers  on the street did not reach the threshold of an imminent safety risk. Since there \nwere no exigent circumstances here, it follows that the practicable option was for the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n \n police to obtain a warrant to search Mr. Gammie’s phone or pursue other investigative \nsteps. The objectives of such an investigation may have been different, including efforts \nto identify and locate Dew, and perhaps the larger source of the half ounce of heroin \nlaced with fentanyl. Police were in a position to locate Dew as they could have sought \njudicial authorization for a production order to obtain the information associated with \nDew’s cell phone number (A.R., part V, vol. I, at pp. 184 -85; Criminal Code , \nss. 487.015 and 487.016). When the requirements of a recognized authority for police  \nto conduct a warrantless search are not met, this “confirms that the invasion of privacy \nis not permissible”, in which case “the avenues open to law enforcement authorities are \nto continue to investigate by methods less intrusive than a search and to seek  to obtain \na search warrant should the proper grounds upon which to do so materialize” ( R. v. \nBuhay , 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631,  at para. 36, quoting R. v. Mercer  (1992), 70 \nC.C.C. (3d) 180 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 189).  \n[332]  The record indicates that the poli ce considered whether they required or \nhad authority to engage in the conversation with Mr. Campbell and that they did not \nbelieve they had time to obtain a warrant (A.R., part V, vol. I, at pp. 94 -96). As \npreviously noted, the chosen technique may have re quired authorization under Part VI \nor s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code , and in this case we do not need to pronounce \nconclusively on the proper authorizing provision.  \n[333]  However, we also note that, despite three officers waiting in Mr. Gammie’s \napartment for a pproximately two hours while Officer Orok communicated with \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 176 ---\n \n Mr. Campbell, and an additional two officers attending the building to wait for \nMr. Campbell’s arrival, there is no evidence that police consulted on the appropriate \nauthorization or attempted to obtain any type of telewarrant, even as circumstances \nunfolded. The trial judge accepted the police’s conclusion that a telewarrant would not \nhave been secured in time, but the only evidence in the record providing a basis for this \nconclusion was the polic e’s assertion. There was no practical information about how \nauthorizations could be obtained in that jurisdiction. As a Charter application relating \nto exigent circumstances will only ever be an after -the-fact analysis of whether the \nsearch was reasonable,  there must be a clear evidentiary basis relating to \nimpracticability to allow courts to assess this legal requirement. Along with detailed \nnotes taken by the officers, courts would benefit from a complete picture of the asserted \nexigency and impracticabil it",

Along with detailed \nnotes taken by the officers, courts would benefit from a complete picture of the asserted \nexigency and impracticabil ity. \n[334]  It may very well be that the available judicial resources or the type of \nwarrant required to conduct this type of search would have made it difficult or \nimpossible for police to obtain authorization to search in time had there been the \nrequired level of urgency. However, where no exigent circumstances exist and a search \nor investigative technique engages s. 8 of the Charter , it is not for the courts as \nguardians of the fundamental rights of Canadians to effectively expand warrantless \nsearch powers (see  Wong , at pp.  56-57). A shortage of resources to ensure that \ninvestigative techniques can be carried out in a timely, Charter -compliant manner \ncannot become the basis for diluted Charter protections.  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 177 ---\n \n E. The Evidence Should Be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter  \n[335]  The appellant seeks the exclusion of all text messages obtained pursuant to \nthe police’s investigative technique (other than the first four messages initially viewed \nby police on the phone screen), as well as the evidence of him arriving at Mr . Gammie’s \napartment with the drugs. The evidence was undoubtedly part of a single transaction \nand obtained in a manner that breached the Charter . Having found the threshold \nrequirement is met, we turn to the evaluative component of s. 24(2) of the Charter . \n[336]  Section 24(2) of the Charter mandates that evidence shall be excluded if, \nhaving regard to all the circumstances, its admission would bring the administration of \njustice into disrepute. Whether the admission of evidence obtained in breach of the \nCharter  would bring the administration of justice into disrepute engages three avenues \nof inquiry: (1) the seriousness of the Charter -infringing state conduct; (2) the impact \nof the breach on the accused’s Charter -protected interests; and (3) society’s interest in  \nthe adjudication of the case on its merits ( R. v. Grant , 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. \n353 (“ Grant  2009”), at para. 71).  \n[337]  In this case, the trial judge conducted an analysis in the alternative under \ns. 24(2) and concluded that the evidence should be admitted ( voir dire  reasons, at \nparas.  129-39). In light of its conclusion on exigent circumstances, the Ontario Court \nof Appeal declined to address the s. 24(2) issue (para. 85). Although a trial judge’s \ns. 24(2) analysis normally attracts deference as to  the supporting findings of fact made, \ngiven our disagreement with the trial judge’s conclusion, in this case the s. 24(2) \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 178 ---\n \n analysis can be conducted anew ( Grant  2009, at para. 129; R. v. Le , 2019 SCC 34, \n[2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 138; Tim, at para. 72) . \n(1) The Seriousness of the Charter -Infringing State Conduct  \n[338]  Our task at this stage is to situate the police’s conduct on a “scale of \nculpability”, ranging from inadvertent, technical, or otherwise minor infringements on \none end, to conduct that demonstrates a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights \non the other ( Paterson , at para. 43; Le, at para. 143). We characterize the police conduct \nas falling on the more serious end and therefore find the first Grant  2009  factor favours \nthe exclusion of the evide nce. \n[339]  A number of factors weigh heavily against admission of the evidence: the \npolice’s conduct in the absence of exigent circumstances; the legal uncertainty \nsurrounding the nature of the investigative technique; and the multiple Charter \nbreaches.  \n[340]  The law has been clear for some time that warrantless searches are \npresumptively unreasonable (see, e.g., Hunter ; Collins ; R",

    "text": " factor favours \nthe exclusion of the evide nce. \n[339]  A number of factors weigh heavily against admission of the evidence: the \npolice’s conduct in the absence of exigent circumstances; the legal uncertainty \nsurrounding the nature of the investigative technique; and the multiple Charter \nbreaches.  \n[340]  The law has been clear for some time that warrantless searches are \npresumptively unreasonable (see, e.g., Hunter ; Collins ; R. v. Tessling , 2004 SCC 67, \n[2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 33). As discussed earlier in these reasons, the factual \nfindings in this case do n ot support an imminent risk to the safety of the public or the \npolice — the legal standard required for the doctrine of exigent circumstances to justify \na warrantless search. Rather, the police’s references to the urgency of the situation were \nprimarily ti ed to the investigative convenience of intercepting the drugs, based on the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 179 ---\n \n seriousness of the offence, the fact that drug dealers like Dew typically did not want to \ndrive around with product, and the fact that he appeared impatient (A.R., part V, vol.  II, \nat pp. 179, 181 and 242). In the face of no real evidence to support a finding of \nimminent risk to safety, it is troubling that police did not even attempt to obtain a \ntelewarrant, whether at the beginning or as time passed and events unfolded. In sum, \nthe police relied on exigency for the warrantless search without a valid basis, rendering \nthe Charter -infringing conduct more serious ( Paterson , at para.  47). \n[341]  The police officers’ experience and familiarity with the law further \naggravates the seriousness of the Charter breach  as Mr. Campbell’s warrantless search \ndid not take the police into “uncharted legal waters” ( Le, at para. 149). This Court has \nbeen clear that the exclusion of evidence is warranted “for clear violations of well -\nestablished rules governin g state conduct” ( Tim, at para. 85, quoting Paterson , at \npara.  44). In our respectful view, the breaches were, taken in their best light, negligent \nas to Charter  standards. Sgt. Bair testified that he had been with the Guelph Police \nService for over 20 years, that he had investigated drugs for “more than half” of his \ncareer and that he had been a “sergeant in charge” of a drug unit since 2013 (A.R., \npart V, vol. I, at pp. 3 -4). Officer Orok was a qualified level  V undercover officer, \nwhich was the “highest” qualification possible, and had been specifically part of the \ndrug unit for approximately four and a half years ( pp. 193 -94). Similarly, Officer \nBrown had been with the dru g unit for over five years (p. 114). As in every case, police \nare “ rightly expected to know what the law is”, particularly when, as here, the law on \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 180 ---\n \n warrantless searches is well settled and the officers involved had decades of experience \n(Grant  2009, at pa ra. 133).  \n[342]  We would also note that none of these experienced officers testified at the \nvoir dire  as to which warrant would have been required to authorize their investigative \ntechnique (A.R., part V, vol. I, at pp. 59, 96, 183 and 185). Nor did any of these  officers \nattempt to obtain judicial authorization in the approximately two -hour timeframe \nduring which they communicated with Mr. Campbell, arranged the drug sale and \nwaited for him to arrive. In these circumstances, the lack of any demonstrated effort to  \neven attempt to obtain any judicial authorization was particularly puzzling considering \nthat one of the officers at the scene was the same officer who had drafted the search \nwarrant for Mr. Gammie’s residence (p. 118).  \n[343]  As of the date of Mr. Campbell’s arrest, the law in Ontario, per the Court \nof Appeal of Ontario’s decision in R. v. Marakah , 2016 ONCA 542, 131 O.R. (3d) 561, \nwas that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in a co -accused’s cell phone. \nThis point was reversed by this Court in Marakah  (A.R., part V, vol. I, at pp",

    "text": "  As of the date of Mr. Campbell’s arrest, the law in Ontario, per the Court \nof Appeal of Ontario’s decision in R. v. Marakah , 2016 ONCA 542, 131 O.R. (3d) 561, \nwas that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in a co -accused’s cell phone. \nThis point was reversed by this Court in Marakah  (A.R., part V, vol. I, at pp. 95 -97 and \n180-83).  \n[344]  However, even though the police may have operated under the existing law \nwith respect to Mr. Campbell’s privacy interest when they  viewed  Mr. Gammie’s \nphone, their lega l authority to impersonate  Mr. Gammie (by virtue of his arrest and \nwithout his knowledge) and usurp control of a private, ongoing, conversation remained \nwholly unclear at the time of the investigation. When faced with such uncertainty, “the \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 181 ---\n \n police would do  well to err on the side of caution” ( TELUS , at para. 80; R. v. \nMcColman , 2023 SCC 8, at paras. 60 and 63). The police testified that they had \nconcerns regarding whether there was proper authorization for them to engage and \nrespond to the incoming messages , but instead quickly decided to proceed without \nauthorization. In the face of clear uncertainty, the police should have exercised caution, \nand not opted to engage in an intrusive and prospective investigative technique. We \nhave found that there were no ex igent circumstances and that this technique could not \nbe authorized pursuant to s. 11 of the CDSA . These findings exacerbate the seriousness \nof the Charter -infringing conduct.   \n[345]  A final factor is that the multiple Charter  breaches in this case further \naggravate the seriousness of the police’s conduct. Although the trial judge found no \ns. 8 breach in respect of the police’s text message conversation with Mr. Campbell, he \ndid find that the police engaged in an unauthorized search of Mr. Campbell’s phone \nfollo wing his arrest, despite there being no compelling risk at the time that the evidence \non the phone would be lost or destroyed. This constituted a separate breach of \nMr. Campbell’s s. 8 rights ( voir dire  reasons, at paras. 124 -28). This Court has \npreviously  situated police misconduct on the graver end of the scale where there are \nmultiple “serious Charter breaches throughout the investigative process” ( Reeves , at \npara.  65).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 182 ---\n \n [346]  The absence of exigency or impracticability, combined with a legally \nquestionable te chnique, and the additional breach of Mr. Campbell’s s. 8 rights \ncumulatively militate against admission of the evidence.  \n(2) The Impact of the Breach on the Accused’s Charter -Protected Interests  \n[347]  The second Grant  2009 factor strongly favours exclusion of the  evidence.  \n[348]  From a reasonable expectation of privacy perspective, Mr. Campbell had a \nsubstantial Charter -protected interest in the conversation he had with Mr. Gammie. \nThe conversation revealed private information that went to Mr. Campbell’s \nbiographical c ore. We would reject the respondent’s invitation to find that the impact \nof the breach on Mr. Campbell’s privacy interests was diminished because the \nconversation “did not reveal intimate details” about him (R.F., at para. 110). Although \nthe text messages pertained to directions and updates on the estimated time of arrival, \ntaken as a whole, they clearly reflected Mr. Campbell’s criminal “lifestyle and personal \nchoices”, something that was obvious to police at the time of their use of the \ninvestigative tech nique ( Marakah  (SCC), at paras. 32 and 54; R. v. Patrick , 2009 SCC \n17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para.  32). Communicating by text message automatically \ncreates a written record of our conversations — and the Charter  is designed to protect \nagainst the insidio us possibility that the state may, “in its unfettered discretion”, access \nthose records ( Marakah  (SCC), at para. 40; see also  Duarte , at p. 44).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 183 ---\n \n [349]  The impact of the breach on Mr. Campbell’s Charter -",

As noted \nby the Court of Appeal below, the police technique employed here was “far more \nintrusive” than merely inspecting a conversation between two other individuals, which \nis what occurred in Marakah  (SCC) (para.  71). Here, the police actively participated in \ncreating the record of the criminal prosecution against Mr. Campbell by posing as \nanother individual with whom he understood to be having a private conversation. We \nhave highlighted why this police technique resu lts in a particularly high degree of \nintrusion in our analysis on the reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n[350]  Discoverability may be useful for assessing the impact of the breach. It \nallows a court to assess the strength of the causal connection between the res ultant \nevidence and the Charter  infringement  (see R. v. Beaver , 2022 SCC 54, at para. 125, \nciting  Grant  2009, at para. 122). In the present case, it is solely through impersonating \nMr. Gammie that police caused the incriminating texts to be sent and manufactured the \ndrug transaction. The text message evidence was  only discoverable through the Charter \nbreach , which results in a greater impact on the accused’s Charter -protected interests \n(Tim, at para. 94) The strong causal connection between the Charter  breach and the \nevidence obtained amplifies the impact on Mr. Campbell.  \n(3) Society’s Interest in the Adjudicat ion of the Case on Its Merits  \n[351]  The third Grant  2009 factor favours admission of the evidence (A.F., at \npara. 64).  \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 184 ---\n \n [352]  The evidence obtained pursuant to the police’s investigative technique — \nthe text message conversation, as well as the appearance of Mr. Camp bell with the \ndrugs at the residence — is reliable evidence of a serious crime ( Grant 2009, at \npara.  81). Exclusion of this evidence would “effectively gu[t] the prosecution” against \nMr. Campbell (para. 83). In such circumstances, society has a strong inte rest in the \nadjudication of the case against Mr. Campbell on its merits.  \n[353]  Nevertheless, we stress that the seriousness of the offence in this case — \nfentanyl trafficking — is not determinative of the analysis at the third stage of Grant  \n2009. In the sentenc ing context, fentanyl trafficking has been recognized as an \nextremely serious offence given the potency and potential lethality of the drug — \nwhich, logically within the sentencing realm of law, leads to increases in penalties for \nthis crime (see, e.g., Parranto ). However, in the context of s. 24(2) of the Charter , the \nseriousness of the offence “has the potential to cut both ways” ( Grant  2009, at \npara.  84). While the public’s interest in a determination on the merits is heightened \nwhere the offence charged  is serious, “it also has a vital interest in having a justice \nsystem that is above reproach, particularly where the penal stakes for the accused are \nhigh” (ibid. (emphasis added)). In line with this principle, this Court has excluded \nevidence under s. 24( 2) even where there was reliable evidence of extremely serious \noffences — including trafficking 35 kilograms of cocaine ( R. v. Harrison , 2009 SCC \n34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494); trafficking in firearms ( Marakah  (SCC)); and possessing and \naccessing child pornogra phy ( Reeves ). Mr. Campbell was found trafficking half an \nounce of heroin laced with fentanyl. Arguing that admission will always be the result \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 185 ---\n \n where the evidence is reliable and the charge is serious is clearly “not the law” \n(Harrison , at para.  40).  \n[354]  While  the third Grant  2009 factor overall favours admission, this is not",

We must balance all three factors to determine whether admission \nof the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  \n(4) Balancing the Factors  \n[355]  We are of the view that the evidence should be excluded. Police bypassed \nthe prospect of even attempting to obtain a warrant despite there being no evidence that \nobtaining a warrant was impracticable in the circumstances. The purpose of exclusion \nof evidence  under s. 24(2) of the Charter is not “to punish police or compensate for a \nrights infringement” ( Le, at para.  139). Rather, s. 24(2) directs that “evidence must  be \nexcluded” if doing so is necessary to “maintain the ‘integrity of, and public confidence \nin, the justice system’” ( ibid. (emphasis in original), citing Grant  2009, at paras. 68 -70).  \n[356]  The protections afforded by s. 8 of the Charter  — including the high bar \nfor exigent circumstances that can justify a warrantless search — do not automatically \nfall by the wayside just because police believe fentanyl is likely to be involved in a \ndrug transaction. Although the police’s belief proved correct in Mr. Campbell’s case, \n“for every Charter  breach that comes before the courts, many others may go \nunidentified  and unredressed because they did not turn up relevant evidence leading to \na criminal charge” ( Grant 2009, at para. 75). This concern is ever present where police \n2024 SCC 42 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 186 ---\n \n may be inclined to dilute exigent circumstances in the name of preventing a risk of \nserious h arm occurring, even if that risk is remote, uncertain, or never materializes at \nall. The long -established presumption against warrantless searches, and the need to \nrespect the bounds of any clearly circumscribed exceptions to this rule, remain vital \nprereq uisites to ensuring s. 8 is not categorically whittled away.   \n[357]  Balancing the Grant 2009 factors in this case, both the first and second \nstrongly favour exclusion. In such a case, this Court has noted that the third factor “will \nseldom if ever tip the balan ce in favour of admissibility” ( Le, at para. 142;  Paterson , at \npara.  56). On balance, we are satisfied that the administration of justice would be \nbrought into disrepute by the admission of this evidence. The evidence should be \nexcluded.  \nIV.
