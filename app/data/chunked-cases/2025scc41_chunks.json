All three had been injected with large doses of \ninsulin. The accused and her mother made  a full recovery, but the child suffered life -\naltering injuries. The accused  was charged with two counts of attempted murder by \nadministering a noxious substance, contrary to s.  239(1)(b) of the Criminal Code , and \ntwo counts of aggravated assault, contrary  to s. 268(2). At the accused’s trial before a \njury, the Crown’s case rested on the theory that the accused , a nurse, had both the \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n motive — ongoing family law proceedings for access to and custody of the child  — \nand opportunity to inject her mother and chi ld with insulin before attempting to end her \nown life. Emptied insulin pens were found in the apartment,  as well as  a handwritten \nletter that the Crown suggested was the accused’s suicide note. One of the defence \ntheories was that responsibility lay with t he accused’s mother, who could have  injected \nthe child, the accused  and herself with insulin.  \n Regarding the count for the attempted murder of the accused’s mother, \namong other instructions, the trial judge instructed the jury that the Crown could \ndischar ge its onus with respect to the actus reus with proof beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the accused  administered the substance by injecting the insulin into her mother  \nherself, or that the",

    "text": " that responsibility lay with t he accused’s mother, who could have  injected \nthe child, the accused  and herself with insulin.  \n Regarding the count for the attempted murder of the accused’s mother, \namong other instructions, the trial judge instructed the jury that the Crown could \ndischar ge its onus with respect to the actus reus with proof beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the accused  administered the substance by injecting the insulin into her mother  \nherself, or that the accused procured the insulin pens and provided them to her mother \nwith the intent that her mother  would use them to inject herself. He added that it did \nnot matter if the mother  was a willing participant in any or all of the actions undertaken \nby the accused . For the c ounts concerning the child,  the trial judge instructed th e jury, \nafter other instructions, on the alternative ways the accused’s guilt could be established \nshould they accept that the accused’s mother was the one to inject the insulin.  \n The ac cused  was convicted of attempted murder of her child and of her \nmother  and of agg ravated assault of her child. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial \non the count of attempted murder of the mother,  holding that the jury needed to be \ninstructed on the distinction be tween attempted murder under s.  239 of the Criminal \nCode and aiding suicide under s.  241(1)(b). Specifically, in its view, the accused  could \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n have provided the insulin to her mother, who could have injected herself in an attempt \nto die by suicide,  and the mother’s  willing participation and desire to die would have \nbeen relevant to whether the accused was guilty of her attempted murder. The Court of \nAppeal did not disturb the accused’s convictions related to the child.  \n Held (Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis and Moreau  JJ. dissenting in part) : \nThe Cr own’s appeal should be allowed and the accused’s appeal should be dismissed.   \n Per Côté, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and O’Bonsawin  JJ.: The \naccused’s  convicti on for the attempted murder of her mother  should be restored. The \njury did not need to be instr ucted on the distinction between attempted murder  and \naiding suicide.  Aiding suicide was neither charged nor is it a lesser included offence, \nand there was no air of reality to a scenario in which the accused aided her mother in \nself-administering the insu lin with an intention to end her own life. As for the accused’s  \nconvictions for attempted murder and aggr avated assault of her child, they should be \nupheld . The trial judge prope rly equipped the jury to decide the accused’s  guilt on all \nrelevant charges . \n Courts must adopt a func tional approach when reviewing jury  instructions \nfor legal error. The central consideration is whether the instructions properly equipped \nthe jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. A properly equipped \njury ca n be understood as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed, not \nperfectly instructed. To determine if an instruction was accurate, an appellate court \nmust ask whether the jury had an accurate understanding of the law. To determine if an \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n instruction was sufficient, an appellate court must consider whether the instruction was \nrequired, and, if so, whether it was provided in sufficient detail for the jury to undertake \nits task. Both the accuracy and sufficiency of the instructions must be consi dered in the \ncontext of the circumstances of the trial as a whole, including the evidence, the closing \narguments of counsel, and the silence of counsel.  \n No view is expressed on whether someone voluntarily attempting to end \ntheir own life precludes all lia bility for attempted murder in respect of that attempt.  \nEven if this were correct, it is only where the theory that the victim attempted suicide \nhas an air of reality that the jury would need to be instructed that a person charged with \nattempted murder cou ld be not guilty by reason of a suicide attempt.   \n  Trial judges must instruct the jury on each required element of the offences \ncharged in every case, regardless of the circumstances, but must only instruct on \ndefences and included offences where they hav e an air of reality . Asking whether there \nis an air of reality involves a contextual assessment as to whether the necessary factual  \ninferences are available on a reasonable view of the evidence .

Asking whether there \nis an air of reality involves a contextual assessment as to whether the necessary factual  \ninferences are available on a reasonable view of the evidence . Any defence theory \nrealistically available on the totality of the evidence should be left with the jury.  The \nair of reality threshold serves as an important screening mechanism, ensuring that \ntheories with no real evidentiary foundation are withheld from the jury, as instructing \nthe jury on such theories would only serve to cause confusion and needlessly lengthen \nthe judge’s charge.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n  Analogously, even if it were true that an accused is not guilty of attempted \nmurder where a victim voluntarily self -adminis ters with the intent to end their own life, \nthis theory must be supported by an evidentiary foundation and  a trial judge would only \nneed to instruct the jury on that theory if it had an air of reality on the record. \nConfirming that an air of reality would be required is important because it may be \ndifficult in a given case to prove the specific intent of the victim of a murder attempt. \nAn accused must not be allowed to escape criminal liability by baldly asserting the \nvictim intended to bring about their ow n death.  \n Where the inquiry into an air of reality involves circumstantial evidence, a \nlimited weighing of the evidence is required. This involves identifying the array of \nfactual inferences that could reasonably be drawn, rather than identifying inferenc es \nthat are more plausible than others. It is not enough for the judge to focus on whether \nthere is some evidence that could raise an inference. The judge must go on to ask \nwhether the evidence is sufficient such that a properly instructed jury could reaso nably \narrive at the relevant conclusion.  The positions of the parties may be relevant context, \nin particular where the accused makes concessions or chooses not to lead a defence at \ntrial, as this may confirm that the defence has no air of reality, but this  should not be \nmisunderstood to mean that statements made by counsel at trial can give an air of reality \nto a theory that is not reasonably available on the evidence.  \n In the instant case, adopting the functional approach to review of jury \ninstructions, th e jury was properly equipped to decide the accused’s guilt on the \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n attempted murder of her mother . Since the accused was not charged with aiding suicide \nand this offence is not included in the offence of attempted murder in this case, the jury \ndid not need to consider whether the accused  was guilty of this offence.  Further, since \nthere was no air of reality to the theory that  the accused aided her mother in self -\nadministering the insulin with the intent to voluntarily end her own life, the trial judge \nwas ri ght not to address it in his jury instructions.  \n In considering the evidence about the circumstances surrounding the \npurported suicide attempt, which  informs whether  it has an air of reality, the key \nquestion is whether the conclusions that the accused’s mother self -administered the \ninsulin and did so voluntarily, intending to end her own life, are both available on the \nsame reasonable view of the evidence as a whole.  The circumstantial evidence relied \non by the accused is that (1)  there was no evidence of  a struggle between the accused \nand her mother in the apartment; (2)  the accused could not physically overpower her \nmother ; and (3)  the handwritten letter that the Crown suggested was a suicide note was \nco-authored by both of them . Taking this evidence at its most favourable, considered \nalongside the remainder of the evidence and reading the record as a whole, there is no \nair of reality to the theory that the accused’s mother had suicidal intent. There is no \ntestimony from the mother or anyone else suggesti ng such intent and it would be \nspeculative to suggest that the handwritten letter evidences that intent. This assessment \nof the totality of the evidence is further supported by the circumstances at trial, in which \nneither party advanced the theory that the  accused and her mothe r had each injected \nthemselves with insulin with the intent to end their own lives. The trial judge’s \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n instructions provided the jury with everything required to decide whether  the accused \nwas guilty of the attempted murder of her moth er on the record.  \n As well, the trial judge properly equipped the",

    "text": " the circumstances at trial, in which \nneither party advanced the theory that the  accused and her mothe r had each injected \nthemselves with insulin with the intent to end their own lives. The trial judge’s \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n instructions provided the jury with everything required to decide whether  the accused \nwas guilty of the attempted murder of her moth er on the record.  \n As well, the trial judge properly equipped the jury to decide the accused’s \nguilt on the offences of attempted murder and aggravated assault of the child. For each \noffence, the jury was accurately instructed on the available verdicts in light of the \ndefence theory  that the accused’s mother, acting independently of the accused, injected \nthe child with insulin. Moreover, the trial judge accurately instructed the jury on the \nmens rea  and actus reus  of the offences, including in a scenario in which it was the \naccused’s mother who actually injected the child with insulin. Finally, the trial judge \nadequately summarized the evidence concerning the procurement of insulin pens and \nrightly invited the jury  to draw its own conclusion on the evidence.  \n Per Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis  and Moreau  JJ. (dissenting in part): \nThere is agreement with the majority that the accused’s appeal from her convictions \nregarding  the child should be dismissed.  However, the C rown’s appeal should also be \ndismissed. A new trial is necessary on the charge of attempted murder of the accused’s \nmother  because  there was an air of reality to the defence’s theory that the accused aided \nher mother’s suicide attempt. The trial judge erre d in law by not instructing the jury on \nthe legal significance of this theory of liability to the actus reus analysis of the \nattempted murder of the accused’s mother.   \n A trial judge has a positive duty to instruct the jury on all relevant questions \nof law that arise on the evidence, whether or not a party has raised the issue. This duty \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n \n arises most commonly in the context of defences, but also requires the trial judge to \nexplain the legal significance of other matte rs that have an air of reality , because  it is \nan error of law to omit any instructions the jury needs to properly undertake its task. \nThe air of reality test simply requires that an inference be available on the whole of the \nevidence. It is a legal error to identify an inference that seems more plausible than \nothers, and then reject the less plausible inferences  as unreasonable. Doing so oversteps \nthe judge’s limited role in assessing an air of reality, a low evidentiary threshold, and \ninvolves weighing the substantive merits. If a viable theory is available on the evidence, \nit must be submitted to the jury’s thoughtful consideration in the absence of compelling \nreasons against doing so.  \n In the instant case, the circumstantial evidence grounds an air of reality to \nthe factual inference  that the accused’s mother  injected herself with insulin intending \nto commit suicide. While  there is no direct evidence that the accused  deceived or \ncoerced her mother into s elf-administering the insulin, on a  common -sense view of the \nevidence, it seems at least as likely that her mother  injected herself with insulin \nintending to die as that she did so without that intent. Fur ther, in the context of the \ncharge for attempted murder of the child, there was an ai r of reality to the theory that \nthe accused’s mother inten ded to kill the child, the accused, and then herself. Therefore, \nthere must also h ave been an air  of reality to the theory that the accused’s mother \nintended to inject herself to bring about her own death. Further, because the jury \nacquitted the accused of aggravated assault of her mother, it can be inferred from that \nverdict that the jury had a reasonable doubt about whether the accused  physically \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n injected her mother with insulin . Given the Crown’s alternative theory, it can also be  \ninferred that the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused administered  \nthe insulin by procuring it  and instructing her mother on how to inject herself. \nTherefore,  the trial judge’s instruction that it  did not matter if the jury  found that th e \naccused’s mother was a willing participant in any or all actions undertaken by the \naccused  was inaccurate. The inference that the accused’s mother injected herself with \ninsulin in a suicide attempt required further jury instructions because it directly \nimpacted the",

    "text": " reasonable doubt that the accused administered  \nthe insulin by procuring it  and instructing her mother on how to inject herself. \nTherefore,  the trial judge’s instruction that it  did not matter if the jury  found that th e \naccused’s mother was a willing participant in any or all actions undertaken by the \naccused  was inaccurate. The inference that the accused’s mother injected herself with \ninsulin in a suicide attempt required further jury instructions because it directly \nimpacted the actus reus  for attempted murder. The trial judge was therefore required \nto make the distinction between  the offences of attempted murder and aiding suicide \nclear to the jury.  \n Parliament deliberately chose to create separate offences for culpa ble \nhomicide (and attempted murder) and aiding suicide, the latter carrying a lesser moral \nblameworthiness than the former. Because the actus reus of culpable homicide , in all \nits different forms, is causing the death of another, causation will be a key is sue when \nassessing actus reus . The one standard of causation for all forms of culpable homicide \nasks whether the actions of the accused were a significant contributing cause of death.  \nThis standard requires proof of both factual and legal causation.  \n The l egal distinction in the elements of the offences of aiding suicide and \nculpable homicide  arises squarely in the context of legal causation when establishing \nthe actus reus . Legal causation is an assessment of moral blameworthiness and whether \nan accused sh ould be held criminally responsible for the consequences of their actions. \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n It also considers the issue of when an intervening act can break the chain of causation. \nIf the deceased took their own life autonomously and of their own free will, this \nindependen t choice to act to cause their own death may sever an accused’s legal \ncausation for culpable homicide because those circumstances reduce an accused’s \nmoral blameworthiness. An accused’s actions will therefore not be a significant \ncontributing cause of deat h, and an acquittal for any culpable homicide charge, or for \nan inchoate offence such as attempted murder, should follow. Depending on the nature \nand extent of the accused’s actions, they may however be liable for aiding suicide. But \nwhere the accused’s ac tions somehow actively undermine d or overpowered the \ndeceased’s autonomous choice whether to commit suicide, then the suicide may no \nlonger qualify as an independent intervening act, and causation for culpable homicide \nmay be established.  \n In the instant c ase, given the air of reality to the theory that the accused’s \nmother injected herself with the intent to commit suicide, the trial judge  was obliged to \ninstruct the jury as  to whether her choice had severed the chain of causation, such that \nthe accused wo uld no longer have been a significant contributing cause of her mother’s \ndeath. The jury should have been instructed that if it found that the accused’s mother’s \nchoice was independent and autonomous, then it should acquit the accused  of attempted \nmurder.  \nCases Cited  \nBy O’Bonsawin  J. \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n  Applied:  R. v.

Overview  \n[1] B.F., her 19 -month -old daughter, E., and her mother, I.F., were found \nunconscious in their family apartment. All three had been injected with large doses of \ninsulin. All three survived, with B.F. and I.F. making a full recover y. E., however, \nsuffered life -altering injuries and requires intensive medical care for the rest of her life.  \n[2] A jury convicted B.F. of the attempted murder of E. and I.F., as well as the \naggravated assault of E. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge’s instructions \nwrongly permitted the jury to convict B.F. of the attempted murder of I.F. based on \nacts that could instead constitute the distinct offence of aiding suicide under s. \n241(1)(b) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C -46. Specifically, B.F. could have \nprovided the insulin to I.F., who could have injected herself in an attempt to die by \nsuicide. As a result, the Court of Appeal set aside B.F.’s attempted murder conviction \nregarding I.F. and ordered a new trial on that count. The Court of Appeal did not disturb \nB.F.’s convictions related to E.  \n[3] The Crown and B.F. appeal to this Court. Both appeals concern the \nadequacy of the trial judge’s jury instructions.  \n[4] The Crown seeks to restore B.F.’s conviction for the attempted murder of \nI.F. It arg ues that B.F. could be found guilty of attempted murder even if I.F. had \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n injected herself with insulin, provided that B.F. procured and provided the insulin to \nI.F. with the intent that I.F. would inject herself, and that B.F. meant to kill I.F. when \ntakin g these active steps. In the alternative, the Crown contends that there was no air \nof reality to the theory that I.F. intended to die by suicide, such that the trial judge’s \nfailure to instruct on this theory was not an error (transcript, at pp. 5 -8). \n[5] B.F. asks this Court to set aside her remaining convictions for the attempted \nmurder and aggravated assault of E. and to order a new trial. She argues that the trial \njudge made various errors when instructing the jury on those offences.  \n[6] For the reasons that f ollow, I would allow the Crown’s appeal, restore \nB.F.’s conviction for the attempted murder of I.F., and dismiss B.F.’s appeal.  \n[7] In my view, the Court of Appeal unnecessarily complicated this matter by \nholding that the jury needed to be instructed on the di stinction between attempted \nmurder under s. 239 of the Criminal Code  and aiding suicide under s. 241(1)(b). The \ndistinct offence of aiding suicide was neither charged nor is it a lesser included offence. \nFurther, there was no air of reality to a scenario i n which I.F. self -administered the \ninsulin with an intention to end her own life. The trial judge was therefore correct not \nto address this scenario in his instructions, which properly equipped the jury to decide \nB.F.’s guilt  on all relevant charges . The q uestion of the legal relationship between \nattempted murder and aiding suicide has no bearing on the appeals.  \nII. Background  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n [8] B.F. worked as a surgical nurse. In 2016, she married A.N. after a period \nof dating and they had a daughter, E. The couple then separate d when E. was nearly \nthree months old, prompting B.F. to move into her parents’ apartment with E.  \n[9] B.F. and A.N.’s relationship continued to deteriorate after their separation, \nresulting in concurrent criminal and family law proceedings. Between May and Jun e \n2018, A.N. and B.F. each filed separate applications for access to and custody of E. \nAround the same time, A.N. pleaded guilty to uttering threats and criminal harassment \nagainst B.F. In June 2019, B.F. was granted interim sole custody of E., while A.N. was \ngranted limited supervised access. Dissatisfied with this outcome, B.F. sought a stay of \nthe order and leave to appeal the decision.  \n[",

In June 2019, B.F. was granted interim sole custody of E., while A.N. was \ngranted limited supervised access. Dissatisfied with this outcome, B.F. sought a stay of \nthe order and leave to appeal the decision.  \n[10] On the morning of June 12, 2019, B.F.’s father, who was out of town, \nbecame increasingly concerned after repeated fail ed attempts to contact his daughter \nand wife. Fearing something was wrong, he contacted a neighbour, with whom he had \nleft keys to the apartment, to check on them. After entering the apartment, the \nneighbour found E. unconscious in her crib, along with B.F . and I.F. unconscious on \nB.F.’s bed. Emergency responders, who arrived in the apartment shortly thereafter, \ndiscovered five emptied insulin pens.  \n[11] B.F. and I.F. have since made full recoveries. E., however, suffered \ndevastating and life -altering harm. She  now faces a shortened life expectancy and a \npoor quality of life, suffering permanent brain damage and irreparable damage to \nmultiple other organs. She will require intensive medical care for the rest of her life.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n III. Judicial History  \nA. Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Dunphy J.)  \n[12] B.F. was charged with two counts of attempted murder by administering a \nnoxious substance, contrary to s. 239(1)(b) of the Criminal Code , and two counts of \naggravated assault, contrary to s. 268(2) of the Criminal Code , in relation t o E. and I.F. \nTwo counts of administering a noxious substance with the intent to endanger life or \ncause bodily harm, contrary to s. 246(b) of the Criminal Code , were withdrawn as \nduplicative during the trial.  \n[13] The Crown’s case rested on the theory that B.F.  had both the motive and \nopportunity to inject I.F. and E. with insulin before attempting to end her own life. The \nCrown suggested that the distress of the ongoing family law proceedings provided a \nmotive, while the opportunity arose from B.F.’s access to insulin pens, and knowledge \nof how to use them, through her employment as a nurse.  \n[14] The defence theories were that responsibility lay either with A.N. or, \nalternatively, with I.F. It was suggested that I.F. shared the same motive as B.F. As for \nA.N.’s moti ve, the defence alleged that he had a history of uttering threats against B.F. \nand was determined to prevent B.F. from proceeding with her family law appeal.  \n[15] The jury heard that B.F., I.F., and E. had all been injected with insulin. E. \nhad several visible injection marks, while B.F. and I.F. showed no visible marks. There \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n was evidence that I.F. and E. were administered doses that would have proved fatal if \nnot for the intervention of the emergency responders.  \n[16] The jury heard that emergency responders found s everal needle cartridges \nand depressed syringes alongside five emptied insulin pens in the apartment. They also \ndiscovered government -issued identification cards of both B.F. and I.F. and a notebook \nopened to a handwritten letter on the television stand in  the living room. The Crown \nsuggested that the handwritten letter was B.F.’s suicide note.  \n[17] The letter, signed by B.F., stated in part: “I gave my child everything in my \npower, I dedicated my life to that child and I love her with my whole heart and soul. It \nis heartbreaking that because I am more intelligent than most of your herd of sheep, \nyour system has decided to punish my child. But know that in the end I will never allow \nfor anyone to abduct or hurt my baby” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 150 -53). \n[18] B.F. and I .F. both testified. B.F. described her troubled relationship with \nA.N., including issues related to drug use as well as emotional and physical abuse. She \ntestified about emails she had sent to the Prime Minister as a plea for help with her \nfamily law proce edings against A.N. While B.F. acknowledged writing the",

She \ntestified about emails she had sent to the Prime Minister as a plea for help with her \nfamily law proce edings against A.N. While B.F. acknowledged writing the letter, she \ndenied having left the notebook open on the television stand. She maintained that the \nletter was not a suicide note, but rather further correspondence intended for the Prime \nMinister in re sponse to the prior email correspondence relating to the family law \nproceedings. B.F. also testified that, although disappointed by the family law \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n \n proceedings, she was not upset by the access decision, nor did she harbour any hatred \ntoward A.N.  \n[19] B.F. denie d having taken insulin pens from her workplace and claimed she \nhad no knowledge of how they came to be in her apartment. She testified that she did \nnot inject either E. or I.F. with insulin, nor did she believe her mother injected her or \nher daughter. B.F.  recalled that her final memory before losing consciousness was lying \nin bed, playing with E. and I.F.  \n[20] I.F. testified that she never saw insulin pens or syringes in the apartment, \nnor did she see her daughter administering insulin to anyone. Like B.F., her  final \nmemory before losing consciousness was lying in bed with her daughter and \ngranddaughter. I.F. also claimed that she had authored the entire letter found on the \ntelevision stand. She dictated its contents to B.F., who then transcribed it into the \nnotebook. She testified that the letter was intended as a correspondence to a United \nNations campaign.  \n[21] Following a jury trial, B.F. was found guilty of both counts of attempted \nmurder. She was also convicted of aggravated assault in relation to E., but acqui tted of \nthe same in relation to I.F.  \n[22] The trial judge stayed the proceedings in relation to aggravated assault as \nduplicative. He imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n for 10 years for the attempted murder of E., and a concu rrent 10 -year sentence for the \nattempted murder of I.F.  \nB. Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2024 ONCA 511, 439 C.C.C. (3d) 421 (van \nRensburg, George and Favreau JJ.A.)  \n[23] B.F. appealed against her convictions and sentence. The Court of Appeal \nallowed the appeal in p art, setting aside her conviction for the attempted murder of I.F. \nand ordering a new trial on that count. It declined to disturb the conviction for the \nattempted murder of E. and the associated sentence.  \n[24] The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge’s i nstructions had wrongly \nleft it open to the jury to convict B.F. of attempted murder based on acts that could \ninstead constitute the distinct offence of aiding suicide under s. 241(1)(b) of the \nCriminal Code . Specifically, the Court of Appeal took issue wi th this passage of the \ntrial judge’s instructions, addressing the actus reus  of the attempted murder of I.F.:  \nThe Crown may satisfy its onus with respect to this essential element with \nproof beyond a reasonable doubt that [B.F.] administered the substance by \ninjecting the insulin into [I.F.] herself. The Crown may also discharge its \nonus with respect to this essential element with proof beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that [B.F.] administered the substance to [I.F.] if she procured the \ninsulin pen or pens and pro vided them to [I.F.] with the intent that [I.F.] \nwould use them to inject herself.  . . .

    "text": " the actions undertaken by [B.F.].  \n \n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 106)  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n [25] The Court of Appeal determined that, had I.F. self -administered the \ninsulin, her willing participation and desire to die would have been relevant to whether \nB.F. was guilty of the attempted murder of I.F. On the Court of Appeal’s view of the \nlaw, where “the will of the person  committing (or attempting to commit) suicide is \noperating”, the trier of fact must consider not only whether the accused supplied the \nsubstance, but also whether the accused interfered with the person’s independent will \nto self -administer that substance ( para. 43). If the latter condition is not met, the accused \nmay be guilty of aiding a suicide attempt rather than attempted murder. Accordingly, \nthe Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that it did not \nmatter whether I.F. was a willing participant in injecting the insulin, as it permitted the \njury to overlook this distinction.  \n[26] This error in the instructions did not affect the attempted murder conviction \nregarding E., who, given her young age, could not have self -administere d the insulin. \nThe Court of Appeal summarily dismissed the other grounds of appeal.  \nIV. Issues and Positions of the Parties  \nA. The Crown’s Appeal  \n[27] The Crown appeals, seeking to restore B.F.’s conviction for the attempted \nmurder of I.F. (A.F., at para. 109). It ar gues that, irrespective of whether I.F. self -\nadministered the insulin, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that B.F. could still \nbe guilty of attempted murder based on her active involvement in providing the insulin \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n and assisting in its administra tion, establishing the actus reus  of this offence (paras. \n104-5). The Crown further argues that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on \nthe mens rea  for attempted murder, namely that B.F. specifically intended to kill I.F. \nwhen she undertook those  actions (para. 106).  \n[28] In the alternative, the Crown argues that this Court could recognize \ncounselling or aiding suicide under s. 241 of the Criminal Code  as a partial defence to \nculpable homicide. In its view, the “air of reality” test would serve as a r obust screening \nmechanism to determine whether the partial defence should be put to the jury  (Crown’s \nCondensed Book, vol. I, at pp. 1 -2). In this case, the Crown submits that the jury did \nnot require additional instructions on suicide because there was no  air of reality to the \ntheory that I.F. intended to die by suicide (transcript, at pp. 5 -7). \n[29] B.F. responds that the Court of Appeal appropriately found that the jury \nwas improperly instructed on this count. She argues that a reasonable possibility that \nI.F. had injected herself with insulin, without any evidence that B.F. misled or coerced \nI.F., would preclude a conviction for attempted murder (R.F., at paras. 92 -94). Instead, \nthe applicable offence would have been aiding suicide, with which she was not cha rged. \nB.F. says that ordinary screening mechanisms, such as the “air of reality” test, would \nserve to prevent unwarranted acquittals based on false claims of suicidal intent (para. \n68). However, she maintains that there is an air of reality to I.F.’s suici dal intent \n(transcript, at pp. 69 -71). In B.F.’s view, the trial judge’s instructions erroneously \npermitted the jury to convict her of the attempted murder of I.F., even where I.F. \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n \n injected herself with insulin as part of a voluntary attempt to end her own  life. As such, \nB.F. asks this Court to dismiss the appeal and confirm the order for a new trial (R.F., \nat paras. 94 and 97).  \n[30] In light of these positions, the sole issue on the Crown’s appeal is whether \nthe trial judge made a reviewable error in instructi ng the jury on the attempted murder \nof I.F.  \nB.

B.F.’s Appeal  \n[31] B.F. also appeals, seeking to have this Court set aside her convictions for \nthe attempted murder and aggravated assault of E. and order a new trial (A.F., at para. \n82). She argues that the trial ju dge committed three errors in instructing the jury on \nthese offences. First, she submits that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury \non the reasonable verdicts available should they accept the alternate theory advanced \nby the defence, namely , that I.F. acted independently in injecting E., B.F., and herself \nwith insulin (paras. 52 -53). Second, B.F. contends that the trial judge erred by failing \nto explain the requisite mens rea  and actus reus for the offences against E., given the \ndefence’s al ternate theory that I.F. injected E. with insulin (paras. 55 -59). Lastly, B.F. \nargues that the instructions misled the jury by suggesting that B.F. had, in fact, procured \nthe insulin pens from her place of employment, when this point was both disputed and \nunsupported by the evidence (para. 65). Other issues, presented in B.F.’s written \nsubmissions but not advanced at the hearing (B.F.’s Condensed Book, at p. 61), were \nmeritless and are not considered in these reasons.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n \n [32] The Crown responds that, when the jury  instructions are considered in their \nentirety, the trial judge sufficiently conveyed the essential elements of attempted \nmurder and the findings necessary to establish B.F.’s guilt (R.F., at para. 37). It submits \nthat the instructions addressed the possib ility that I.F. injected E., and properly \nexplained that the jury had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of B.F.’s specific \nintent to kill E. when she administered the insulin (paras. 40 and 43). Lastly, the Crown \nargues that the trial judge properl y summarized the relevant evidence concerning B.F.’s \naccess to the insulin pens, and only later accepted that this fact had been established for \nthe purpose of sentencing (paras. 48 -49). \n[33] Given these positions, B.F.’s appeal raises the issue of whether the trial \njudge made a reviewable error in instructing the jury on the attempted murder and \naggravated assault of E. This requires the Court to consider the following three sub -\nissues:  \n1. Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury on the \nreasonable v erdicts available should they accept the defence \ntheory that I.F. independently administered the insulin to E.?  \n2. Did the trial judge err by failing to properly instruct the jury on \nthe mens rea  and actus reus of the offences?  \n3. Did the trial judge mislead th e jury in summarizing the \nevidence surrounding the procurement of the insulin pens?  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n \n V. Analysis  \nA. Principles Governing the Review of Jury Instructions  \n[34] As the jury instructions are central to the issues on these appeals, it is \nhelpful to begin by reiterating som e of the key principles governing the review of the \ninstructions in this case.  \n[35] This Court has consistently directed appellate courts to adopt a functional \napproach when reviewing instructions for legal error (see R. v. Abdullahi , 2023 SCC \n19, at para. 34; R. v. Calnen , 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 8; see also \nM. Vauclair, T.  Desjardins and P.  Lachance, Traité général de preuve et de procédure \npénales 2025  (32nd ed. 2025), at para. 33.35). In each case, the central consideration \nis whether t he substance of the instructions, when read in their entirety and considered \nin the context of the trial as a whole, properly equipped the jury to decide the case \naccording to the law and the evidence (see Abdullahi , at para. 35;  Calnen , at para.

    "text": " de procédure \npénales 2025  (32nd ed. 2025), at para. 33.35). In each case, the central consideration \nis whether t he substance of the instructions, when read in their entirety and considered \nin the context of the trial as a whole, properly equipped the jury to decide the case \naccording to the law and the evidence (see Abdullahi , at para. 35;  Calnen , at para. 9; R. \nv. Lozada , 2024 SCC 18, at para. 14; R. v. Goforth , 2022 SCC 25, [2022] 1 S.C.R. 715, \nat paras. 21 -22). A properly equipped jury can be understood as one that is both \naccurately and sufficiently instructed, not perfectly instructed (see R. v. Jacquard , \n[1997]  1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 2 and 32; Abdullahi , at paras. 35, 37 and 58).  \n[36] To determine if an instruction was accurate, an appellate court must ask \nwhether the jury had an accurate understanding of the law (see Abdullahi , at paras. 40 \nand 43). This inquiry is approached from the perspective of the jury’s “overall \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n \n understanding of a given issue” (para. 39). An instruction may be inaccurate, and thus \namount to an error of law, where there is an “ambiguous or problematic statement in \none part of the charge”, bu t not necessarily (para. 41). Accurate statements elsewhere \nin the charge may compensate for the problematic statements and assure the appellate \ncourt that the jury had an accurate understanding of the relevant legal issue.  \n[37] To determine if an instruction w as sufficient, an appellate court must \nconsider whether the instruction was required, and, if so, whether it was provided in \nsufficient detail for the jury to undertake its task ( Abdullahi , at paras. 46 and 72). There \nare both mandatory and contingent inst ructions. Mandatory instructions are those that \nmust be addressed in every case, regardless of the circumstances. They include, for \ninstance, “an explanation of the charges faced by the accused, including the required \nelements of each offence to be left wi th the jury; an explanation of the theories of each \nside; a review of the evidence relating to the law; [and] the possible verdicts open to \nthe jury” (para. 48). Conversely, contingent instructions are determined by the \ncircumstances of the case. For examp le, a jury must be instructed on defences and \nincluded offences if and only if they bear an air of reality on the evidence (see R. v. \nCinous , 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50; R. v. Pan , 2025 SCC 12, at para. \n50; see also E.  G. Ewaschuk, Crimina l Pleadings & Practice in Canada  (3rd ed. (loose -\nleaf)), at § 17:112). Whenever a particular instruction is required, regardless of whether \nthe instruction is mandatory or contingent, it will necessarily be an error of law to omit \nit (Abdullahi , at paras. 48-49 and 72).  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n \n [38] Both the accuracy and sufficiency of the instructions must be considered \nin the context of the circumstances of the trial as a whole ( Abdullahi , at paras. 57 -58). \nThe non -exhaustive list of considerations includes the evidence, the closing a rguments \nof counsel, and the silence of counsel (para. 59). The evidence “informs what the jury \nneeds to understand in order to be equipped properly to decide the case” (para. 60 \n(emphasis in original)). Closing arguments of counsel may fill gaps in the ju dge’s \nreview of the evidence, while the silence of counsel may suggest that an instruction \nwas provided in sufficient detail for the jury to undertake its task (paras. 64 and 68). \nMoreover, both the closing arguments or silence of counsel may inform whethe r a \ncontingent instruction was required (paras. 63 and 68).

However, this context cannot be used to replace  \nthe trial judge’s duty to instruct the jury accurately and sufficiently (para. 58). Appellate \nreview must remain focused on “determining whether the overall effect of the charge \nachieved its function” (para. 72; see also Ewaschuk, at § 17:112; Vauclair, Desjardins \nand Lachance, at para. 33.36).  \n[39] With these principles in mind, I now turn to the Crown’s appeal.  \nB. The Crown’s Appeal  \n[40] The parties to this appeal disagree on the legal relationship between \nattempted murder, under s. 239 of the Criminal Code , and counselling or aiding suicide, \nunder s. 241 of the Criminal Code . Specifical ly, they differ as to whether an accused \ncan be found guilty of attempted murder where they provide a person with lethal tools \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n \n and that person uses those tools in a voluntary attempt to end their own life. The Crown \nsays that this can be attempted murder w here the other elements of this offence are \nmade out on the facts (A.F., at paras. 91 and 99). Conversely, B.F. suggests that this \ncould never amount to attempted murder, but only counselling or aiding suicide under \ns. 241 of the Criminal Code (R.F., at pa ra. 93).  \n[41] I decline to conclusively resolve this abstract legal issue in this appeal. As \nI will explain, on this record there was no air of reality to the theory that B.F. aided I.F. \nin self -administering the insulin with the intent to end her own life. Th e trial judge was \ntherefore right not to address this theory in his instructions. Adopting the functional \napproach to the review of jury instructions, the jury was properly equipped to decide \nB.F.’s guilt on the attempted murder of I.F.  \n(1) The Jury Did Not Ha ve To Decide Whether B.F. Was Guilty of Aiding \nSuicide  \n[42] At the outset, it is important to clarify that the offence of counselling or \naiding suicide was not before the trial court. B.F. was not charged with counselling or \naiding suicide. Further, both partie s submit that counselling or aiding suicide was not \nan included offence to the attempted murder charges at issue (transcript, at pp. 38 -39; \nA.F., at para. 107; R.F., at para. 42). I agree.  \n[43] Included offences provide an alternative basis for a finding of gu ilt (see R. \nv. Wolfe , 2024 SCC 34, at para. 50). An accused may be acquitted of the charged \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n offence, but nonetheless convicted of a lesser included offence, even when there is no \nexplicit reference to the latter in the indictment (see Pan, at para. 49). In cluded offences \nare those that are defined as such in the Criminal Code , as well as those whose elements \nnecessarily “form part of the offence charged, whether ‘as described in the enactment \ncreating it or as charged in the count’ itself” (para. 49, citing  R. v. G.R. , 2005 SCC 45, \n[2005] 2 S.C.R. 371, at paras. 25 and 29 -33; Criminal Code , s. 662). If the charged \noffence as particularized in the indictment could have been committed without \ncommitting another offence, that other offence is not included (see G.R., at paras. 31 -\n32; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at paras. 34.51 -34.52; S.  Penney, V.  Rondinelli \nand J.  Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶11.21).  \n[44] The Criminal Code does not explicitly provide that counselling or aiding  \nsuicide is an offence included in that of attempted murder (s. 662).

Further, the elements \nof counselling or aiding suicide cannot be said to necessarily form part of the attempted \nmurder offences as charged. B.F. is charged that, by administering a noxio us substance, \nshe attempted to murder I.F. A person can attempt to murder someone by administering \na noxious substance in factual circumstances where they would not also be committing \nthe offence of counselling or aiding suicide. For example, administering  a lethal poison \nto a person who is not attempting to die by suicide would clearly not be counselling or \naiding that person to die by suicide.  \n[45] The conclusion that counselling or aiding suicide is not a lesser included \noffence to the attempted murder charg es is further reinforced by appellate court \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n jurisprudence confirming this offence is not included in that of murder (see, e.g., R. v. \nGagnon  (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 143 (Que. C.A.), at pp. 158 -60; Mailhot v. R. , 2012 \nQCCA 964, at paras. 84 -85, rev’d on othe r grounds 2013 SCC 17, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 96).  \n[46] Since B.F. was not charged with counselling or aiding suicide under s. 241 \nof the Criminal Code  and it is not included in the offence of attempted murder in this \ncase, the jury did not need to consider whether B. F. was guilty of this offence. With \nthis said, I agree with the Court of Appeal that this does not provide a complete answer \nto this appeal (para. 51). Rather, the central issue on appeal concerns whether the trial \njudge erred in his instructions for the a ttempted murder of I.F.  \n(2) A Jury Should Not Be Instructed on a Suicide Attempt Precluding Liability \nfor Attempted Murder Where the Suicide Attempt Has No Air of Reality  \n[47] B.F. says that, even though aiding suicide was not charged and is not a \nlesser included o ffence, the trial judge should have addressed the effect of an attempted \nsuicide on her liability for attempted murder in his jury instructions. B.F. argues that if \nthe jury found that I.F. voluntarily injected herself with insulin, B.F. could not be \nconvi cted of attempted murder because I.F.’s death would have been a suicide rather \nthan a homicide (R.F., at paras. 92 -94). Yet, the trial judge instructed the jury that B.F. \ncould be convicted of attempted murder even if I.F. self -administered the insulin. B. F. \nsays that, in the circumstances, it was incumbent on the trial judge to tell the jury to \nconsider whether this  amounted to a  suicide attempt rather than attempted murder.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n \n [48] I express no view on whether B.F.’s understanding of the law is correct. In \npartic ular, I offer no opinion on whether someone voluntarily attempting to end their \nown life precludes all liability for attempted murder in respect of that attempt. \nHowever, even if B.F. were correct on this point, I conclude that it is only where the \ntheory that the victim attempted suicide has an air of reality that the jury would need to \nbe instructed that a person charged with attempted murder could be not guilty by reason \nof that suicide attempt.  \n[49] As outlined above, trial judges must instruct the jury on e ach required \nelement of the offences charged in every case, regardless of the circumstances (see \nAbdullahi , at para. 48). However, trial judges must only instruct the jury on defences \nand included offences where they have an air of reality (para. 49). Broa dly, asking \nwhether there is an air of reality involves a contextual assessment as to “whether the \nnecessary factual inferences are available on a reasonable view of the evidence” ( Pan, \nat para. 52).

As Doherty J.A. put it in R. v. Ali , 2021 ONCA 362, 156 O.R. (3d) 81, \n“any defence theory realistically available on the totality of the evidence  should be left \nwith the jury” (para. 74 (emphasis added); see also Ewaschuk, § 17:112; Vauclair, \nDesjardins and Lachance, at para. 33.22; Pan, at para. 44).  \n[50] The air of reality threshold serves as an important screening mechanism, \nensuring that theories with no real evidentiary foundation are withheld from the jury. \nInstructing the jury on such theories would only serve to “cause confusion, invite \nimproper compromise, and needlessly lengthen the judge’s charge” ( Pan, at para. 42, \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n citing R. v. Park , [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 11; R. v. Osolin , [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at \np. 683).  \n[51] Confusion would result, for example, if trial judges were required to \ninstruct the jury on se lf-defence in every murder case, even where the accused cannot \npoint to any evidentiary foundation. Though self -defence would, in theory, always \ndefeat responsibility for murder where its elements are established, the jury need not \nfind that the Crown has disproved self -defence beyond a reasonable doubt where it has \nno air of reality. This proposition is helpfully illustrated in Cinous . There, the accused, \nwho was convicted of second degree murder, successfully appealed on the ground that \nthe trial judge ha d erred in his instructions to the jury on self -defence. This Court then \nrestored his conviction, holding that this defence lacked an air of reality on the record \nand should have never been put to the jury (paras. 125 -26). \n[52] Analogously, to the extent that t he Court of Appeal and B.F. are correct in \nsaying that an accused is not guilty of attempted murder where a victim voluntarily \nself-administers with the intent to end their own life, this theory must be supported by \nan evidentiary foundation.  \n[53] Confirming th at an air of reality would be required is important in order to \naddress the Crown’s legitimate practical concerns with B.F.’s proposed approach (A.F., \nat paras. 79 -81). It may be difficult in a given case to prove the specific intent of the \nvictim of a mur der attempt, especially where the victim is a child, has no memory of \nthe events, or ultimately dies. An accused must not be allowed to escape criminal \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n liability by baldly asserting the victim intended to bring about their own death. B.F. \nsays that applyin g ordinary screening mechanisms like the air of reality test can be \nrelied on “to prevent unwarranted acquittals on this unusual basis” (R.F., at para. 68). \nI agree.  \n[54] In summary, even if I were to accept B.F.’s submission that I.F.’s voluntary \nsuicide attem pt would be relevant to B.F.’s liability for attempted murder , the trial \njudge would only need to instruct the jury on that theory if it had an air of reality on \nthe record.  \n(3) There Is No Air of Reality to the Theory That B.F. Was Aiding I.F. in a \nSuicide A ttempt  \n[55] I agree with the Crown that there is no air of reality to the theory that I.F. \nvoluntarily injected herself with insulin with the intent to end her life. The trial judge \nappropriately refrained from addressing this theory when instructing the jury.  \n[56] Determining whether there is an air of reality on a given record is an \nexercise guided by principles that have been long settled in our jurisprudence. A trial \njudge must consider the totality of the evidence ( Cinous , at para. 53).

Arcuri , 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 23). Importantly, the weighing  \nof the evidence is limited in that it only involves identifying the array of factual \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n inferences “that could reasonably be drawn”, rather than identifying inferences that are \nmore plausible than others ( Pan, at paras. 64 -65, citing Cinous , at para. 91).  \n[57] This means that the exercise is not one of identifying an inference that \nseems, to the judge, more plausible than others, and then rejecting the less plausible \ninferences as unreasonable (see Pan, at paras. 64 -65, citing Cinous , at paras. 90 -91, and \nVauclai r, Desjardins and Lachance, at para. 33.23), a point on which all agree \n(Karakatsanis and Moreau JJ.’s reasons, at para. 111). But neither is it an unstructured \nexercise in what the judge thinks is common sense or viable in the abstract. It is not \nenough t o focus on whether there is some evidence that could raise an inference. The \njudge must go on to ask whether the evidence is sufficient such that a properly \ninstructed jury could reasonably arrive at the relevant conclusion (see Pan, at para. 52; \nCinous , at para. 82; see also Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para. 33.23). Only \nwhen there is a complete picture of the array of factual inferences that could reasonably \nbe drawn by a jury can the air of reality analysis be meaningfully undertaken. \nOtherwise , any assessment under the air of reality test risks becoming speculative and \ndetached from the governing legal threshold.  \n[58] When conducting a limited weighing of the evidence, it is not permissible \nto assess the credibility or reliability of the evidence, beyond rejecting bare assertions \n(see Pan, at para. 66; Cinous , at para. 90). The evidence must also be understood in \nlight of other circumstances at trial. This includes the positions of the parties, \nparticularly the theories advanced and any concessions made, as well as the live issues \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n raised (see Pan, at paras. 69 -70; R. v. Chalmers , 2009 ONCA 268, 243 C.C.C. (3d) \n338, at pa ras. 52 -53). \n[59] In support of the alternate theory that I.F. could have injected herself with \nthe intention to end her own life, B.F. directs this Court to consider three pieces of \ncircumstantial evidence (transcript, at pp. 69 -70). Specifically, B.F. submits  that there \nwas no evidence of a struggle between B.F. and I.F. in the apartment on the night in \nquestion. B.F. also points to evidence that she could not physically overpower I.F., as \nwell as evidence that the handwritten letter that the Crown suggested w as a suicide note \nwas co -authored by both B.F. and I.F.  \n[60] However, the circumstantial evidence relied on by B.F. must be assessed \nagainst the totality of the evidence. It cannot be considered in isolation. B.F. points to \nthe absence of any signs of a struggl e and evidence that she lacked the capacity to \nphysically overpower I.F. However, all agree that suggesting a person may have self -\nadministered does not on its own establish suicidal intention in every case (see \nKarakatsanis and Moreau JJ.’s reasons, at pa ra. 109). Evidence about the circumstances \nsurrounding the purported self -administration informs whether there is an air of reality \nto a suicide attempt. A person may, for example, self -administer without knowing that \nthis would result in their death. This  is illustrated by scenarios in which death resulted \nfrom the voluntary recreational consumption of drugs or alcohol by the deceased (",

Evidence about the circumstances \nsurrounding the purported self -administration informs whether there is an air of reality \nto a suicide attempt. A person may, for example, self -administer without knowing that \nthis would result in their death. This  is illustrated by scenarios in which death resulted \nfrom the voluntary recreational consumption of drugs or alcohol by the deceased (see, \ne.g., R. v. Fournier , 2023 ONCA 435; R. v. Haas , 2016 MBCA 42, 326 Man. R. (2d) \n302; R. v. C.W. (2006), 209 O.A.C. 1;  R. v. Jordan  (1991), 4 B.C.A.C. 121). In these \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n scenarios, it does not follow from self -administration that the person intended to bring \nabout their death. Similarly, when a person self -administers a potentially lethal dose of \na medication, it will not alw ays be reasonable to infer that they intended to bring about \ntheir death, particularly where they lack medical training and are unfamiliar with the \nmedication and the potential consequences of self -administration. For example, in this \ncase, I.F. testified that she had never seen insulin pens in her apartment before (A.R., \nvol. V, at pp. 333 and 358; see also A.R., vol. I, at p. 120). Unlike B.F., who had medical \ntraining and experience administering insulin (A.R., vol. V, at p. 195), there was no \nevidence s uggesting I.F. would have known how to administer the dose of insulin or \nthe consequences of doing so.  \n[61] Therefore, in considering the surrounding circumstances, even if there \nwere a reasonable inference that I.F. self -administered insulin, this would be \ninsufficient on its own to establish a reasonable inference that I.F. also intended to die. \nThe key question is instead whether the conclusions that I.F. self -administered the \ninsulin and did so voluntarily, intending to end her own life, are both available o n the \nsame reasonable view of the evidence as a whole.  It is necessary to consider the record \nin this particular case to determine if both conclusions are available to a properly \ninstructed jury (see Pan, at paras. 64 -65). \n[62] There is no testimony from I.F. o r anyone else that suggests she intended \nto end her own life. I.F. testified that her last memory that evening was her lying in bed \nwith B.F. and E. (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 313 -14). Her next memory was her release from \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n the hospital, nearly one week later (p.  314). I.F. testified that before losing \nconsciousness, she did not see any insulin pens or syringes in the apartment (pp. 333, \n347 and 358). Nor did she see the identification cards or the handwritten letter placed \ntogether on the television stand in the living room (p. 310). I.F. also testified that she \nwas not upset over the family law proceedings, and denied injecting herself with insulin \n(pp. 333 -34 and 358). While I.F.’s evidence as to her lack of familiarity with insulin \n(see pp. 333 and 358 and also  A.R., vol. I, at p. 120) can certainly support an inference \nthat she was not injected for a legitimate medical reason, this is not the same as saying \nshe injected herself with the intention to die, which is the inference at issue here. In the \ncircumstance s of this case, it would be unreasonable for a jury to infer I.F. had suicidal \nintent just because she did not regularly use insulin.  \n[63] The evidence of the handwritten letter is also insufficient on its own to \nraise an air of reality. At trial, the Crown sug gested that this letter was B.F.’s suicide \nnote (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 100 -101 and 126 -27). The Crown pointed out that the letter is \nlargely written in the past tense, with certain excerpts implying that B.F. would kill \nherself along with I.F. and E. (A.R.,  vol.

At trial, both B.F. and I.F. testified that \nB.F. wrote the letter, though I.F., according to her testimony, dictated its content s by \nreading out a draft she had written (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 219 -20, 256, 325 -29 and 356). \nB.F. explained that she wrote the letter to vent to the Prime Minister in response to past \ncorrespondence relating to the family law proceedings, and not as a suic ide note (pp. \n218-20 and 255 -56; see also A.R., vol. VI, at p. 149). I.F. also testified that B.F. did \nnot write a suicide note, and denied lying to protect her daughter (A.R., vol. V, at pp. \n358-59). No one suggested that the letter reflected suicidal int ent on the part of I.F. \nThere is agreement that saying this letter evidences I.F.’s suicidal intent would be \nspeculative (Karakatsanis and Moreau JJ.’s reasons, at para. 112).  \n[65] Taking the evidence relied on by B.F. at its most favourable, there is no air \nof reality to the theory that I.F. had suicidal intent. In order to reasonably conclude that \nI.F. voluntarily attempted suicide on this record, the jury would not only need to accept \nthat I.F. self -administered the insulin, but also conclude that the letter  was a suicide \nnote, and that it expressed I.F.’s  suicidal intention. In this regard, the jury would need \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n \n to infer that B.F. accurately conveyed what I.F. dictated to her when writing the letter, \nand that it reflected I.F.’s views even though it was signed  only by B.F., was written \nlargely in past tense, and contained language implying that B.F. was going to kill \nherself along with I.F. and E. This chain of inference is not reasonably open to a trier \nof fact on this record because it is tenuous and speculat ive. Principles that have been \nlong settled in our jurisprudence require that we not ground an air of reality on such \ninferences (see, e.g., R. v.

When \nthis letter is considered alongside the remainder  of the evidence and the record is read \nas a whole, there is simply no “viable” theory available on the evidence that B.F. was \naiding I.F. in a suicide attempt ( Pan, at para. 44).  \n[66] The above assessment of the totality of the evidence is further supported \nby the circumstances at trial.

It is true that the Crown cross -examined I.F. on whether \nB.F. instructed her to inject herself, and on whether she was very upset on the night in \nquestion, suggestions that she denied (see A.R., vol. V, at pp. 358 -60). And it i s true \nthe Crown addressed an alternative theory that B.F. was a party to the attempted murder \nof E., in which I.F. also participated before being injected with insulin by B.F. (A.R., \nvol. VI, at pp. 171 and 177; see also A.R., vol. I, at pp. 97 and 101). But B.F. correctly \nacknowledges that, ultimately, neither party advanced the theory at trial that B.F. and \nI.F. had each injected themselves with insulin with the intent to end their own lives \n(R.F., at paras. 13 and 94). The theory that I.F. “injected herself with insulin, provided \nby B.F., intending to end her own life” was “advanced by neither side” (para. 13 \n(emphasis in original)). The Crown’s submission to the jury was that B.F. “was the \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n only one with the means, the opportunity and the motive” to comm it the crimes against \nI.F. and E. (A.R., vol. I, at p. 126; see A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 162 and 170) and that “[s]he \ninjected her mother” (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 162). The defence theories, meanwhile, were \nthat all three individuals had been injected by A.N. o r, alternatively, by I.F. It was the \ntrial judge who raised the legal relationship between attempted murder and aiding \nsuicide during the pre -charge conference, though he ultimately decided to charge the \njury only on attempted murder (pp. 87 -97 and 250 -55). \n[67] I add that, even if the Crown’s questions on cross -examination or \nalternative theories discussed at trial were read to support a theory in which I.F. wished \nto die by suicide, this alone could not ground an air of reality. The analysis is centred \non whet her the relevant factual conclusions are available on a reasonable view of the \nevidence  (see Pan, at para. 52). As the trial judge correctly told the jury in his \ninstructions, questions asked and submissions made by counsel during the trial are not \nevidenc e (see A.R., vol. I, at p. 73). The positions of the parties may be relevant context, \nin particular where the accused makes concessions or chooses not to lead a defence at \ntrial, as this may confirm that the defence has no air of reality (see Chalmers , at paras. \n52-53; R. v. Chacon -Perez , 2022 ONCA 3, 159 O.R. (3d) 481, at para. 167, both cited \nin Pan, at paras. 69 -70; see also Lefebvre v. R. , 2021 QCCA 1548, at paras. 30 -34; R. \nv.

But this should not \nbe misunderstood to mean that statements made by Crown counsel at trial can give an \nair of reality to a theory that is not reasonably available on the evidence.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n [68] To summar ize, there was no air of reality to the theory that B.F. aided I.F. \nin self -administering the insulin with the intent to end her own life.

Ancio , [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, at pp. 247 and 250 -\n51), regardless of whethe r actually committing murder was possible in the \ncircumstances (see, generally, Criminal Code , s. 24;  United States of America v. Dynar , \n[1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at para. 67; R. v. Carson , 2018 SCC 12, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 269, at \npara. 29; R. v. Boone , 2019 ONCA 6 52, 56 C.R. (7th) 432, at para. 114). The trial judge \nclearly directed the jury to consider the specific actions of B.F., beyond those that were \nmerely preparatory, to determine if they would establish the actus reus  of this offence \n(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 9 3 and 105). Specifically, the jury needed to be satisfied that B.F. \nundertook the concrete steps to cause the death of I.F. by administering the insulin (pp. \n93 and 106). The trial judge then directed the jury to consider whether the Crown had \nproved beyon d a reasonable doubt that B.F. had the specific intent to kill I.F. when she \nadministered the insulin to I.F. (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 108 -9). \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n [70] In conclusion, the Court of Appeal erred in disturbing B.F.’s conviction for \nthe attempted murder of I.F. on this gr ound. I will now turn to B.F.’s appeal on the \nconvictions for the attempted murder and aggravated assault of E.  \nC. B.F.’s Appeal  \n[71] B.F. alleges that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the charges \nof attempted murder and aggravated assault of E. In my view, there is no merit to this \nargument. The trial judge properly equipped the jury to decide B.F.’s guilt on these \noffen ces (see Abdullahi , at para. 35; Calnen , at para. 9).  \n(1) The Trial Judge Accurately Instructed the Jury on the Available Verdicts \nin Light of the Defence Theory  \n[72] At trial, B.F. proposed a scenario where I.F. acted independently in \ninjecting E., B.F., and hers elf with insulin (A.R., vol. I, at p. 125). B.F. argues that the \ntrial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury on the available verdicts should it accept \nthis theory. Specifically, she argues that I.F. acting independently of B.F. would \npreclude B.F.’s  liability as both a principal and party to the offences, resulting in a \nverdict of not guilty (A.F., at paras. 52 -53). I am of the view that the trial judge did not \nerr on this point.  \n[73] At the outset of the charge, the trial judge instructed the jury on mot ive, \nthird party suspects, and party liability under s. 21 of the Criminal Code , including the \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n relationship between these concepts. The instructions directly addressed the possibility \nthat I.F. acted as a principal, and reviewed the evidence that connected  I.F. to the \noffences (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 78 and 81 -83). Importantly, the trial judge was explicit \nthat, in considering whether a third party committed the crimes, including I.F., the \nCrown’s burden of proof did not change. The jury was told to return a verdict of not \nguilty if it was left with a reasonable doubt regarding B.F.’",

Importantly, the trial judge was explicit \nthat, in considering whether a third party committed the crimes, including I.F., the \nCrown’s burden of proof did not change. The jury was told to return a verdict of not \nguilty if it was left with a reasonable doubt regarding B.F.’s guilt when considering the \nevidence relevant to the scenario in which I.F. was the principal, along with all of the \nother evidence (p. 81).  \n[74] The trial judge then instructed the ju ry on the alternative ways the Crown \ncould establish B.F.’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, should it accept that I.F. was \nthe one to inject E. with insulin. Specifically, the jury could still find B.F. guilty for the \noffences charged if the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she committed \nthe crimes as a joint principal, as an aider, or as an abettor (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 88 -89). \nThe instructions appropriately summarized these pathways for the specific scenario \nwhere it was I.F., not B.F., who in jected the insulin (at p. 83):  \nIf, after considering [the instructions on party liability] and all of the \nevidence, you conclude that [I.F.] may have injected one or more of the \nthree occupants of the room with insulin that evening, that conclusion \nwould not absolve [B.F.] if you also found that [B.F.] intentionally \nassisted, participated or abetted [I.F.] in committ[ing] the crimes  with the \nnecessary intent to kill. [Emphasis added.]  \n[75] The trial judge revisited the possibility that someone other than B.F. h ad \ncommitted the crimes when instructing on the essential elements of the attempted \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n murder of E. (A.R., vol. I, at p. 97). The actus reus  of attempted murder required the \njury to find that B.F. administered a noxious substance to E. The trial judge specifi ed \nthat to satisfy this element in the scenario where I.F., and not B.F., had injected E., the \njury also had to find that B.F. either: (1) aided I.F. by intentionally taking concrete \nsteps to assist her, or (2) abetted I.F. by procuring the insulin pens, i nstructing her on \ntheir use, and encouraging her to inject E. with a potentially fatal dose of insulin (at p. \n101):  \nIt makes no difference to your decision if you find that the Crown has \nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that [B.F.] herself injected [E.] wi th the \ninsulin or if you are satisfied that either [I.F.] or [B.F.] injected [E.] with \nthe insulin providing you find that if [I.F.] did so, [B.F.] intended her to do \nit and intentionally took concrete steps to assist her doing so or abet her by \nencouragin g her to inject [E.] with a potentially lethal dose of insulin and \ninstructing her on the use of the insulin pens she had procured for this \npurpose . In either case, the Crown will have discharged its burden of \nproving this first essential element. [Emphasi s added.]  \n[76] The Crown relied on this very action, the injection of insulin into E., to \nestablish the first essential element of aggravated assault, being the intentional \napplication of force (A.R., vol. I, at p. 110). Consequently, in instructing on aggravat ed \nassault, the trial judge largely relied on his earlier instructions on the first essential \nelement of the attempted murder of E. The trial judge’s instructions on the charge of \naggravated assault repeated that the jury may find that B.F. intentionally a pplied force \nto E. through one of the four modes of participation (pp. 109 -11).  \n[77] For each offence, the instructions permitted the jury to consider the \npossibility that I.F.’s action of injecting E. was taken entirely independently of B.F. \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n The jury was invi ted to decide whether the evidence supporting that theory raised a \nreasonable doubt regarding B.F.’s guilt — whether as a principal, joint -principal, aider, \nor abettor in the commission of the offences.

Specifically, she states \nthat the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the requirements to establish \nB.F.’s guilt in a scenario where it was I.F. who injected E. (A.F., at paras. 57 -59). I \ndisagree.  \n[80] As described above, the trial judge’s instructions on the actus reus  for \nattempted murder properly specified that, if the jury was not convinced beyond a \nreasonable doubt that B.F. had injected E., it could only find B.F. guilty if it was \nsatisfied that B.F. intended I.F. to inject E. and aided or abetted I.F. in that act (A.R., \nvol. I, at p. 101). When detailing the actus reus  for aggravated assault, the trial judge \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n directed the jury to that instruction and reminded the jury that this element could be \nestablished through these different modes of participation (pp. 110 -11). \n[81] The trial judge properly instructed the jury that the Crown must prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that B.F. had the specific intent to kill  E. in order to find her \nguilty of attempted murder (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 102 and 104 -5). The instructions also \nused the phrases “intended to kill” and “meant to kill” to describe the mens rea  of this \noffence (pp. 102 and 104 -5). \n[82] Crucially, the trial judge  associated B.F.’s state of mind to her conduct that \nthe jury, had it reached the mens rea question in its deliberations, would have already \nfound amounted to administering the noxious substance to E. The trial judge directed \nthe jury to determine whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that \nB.F. specifically intended to kill E. when she undertook those actions (A.R., vol. I, at \np. 102). As described above, in the scenario where I.F. and not B.F. had injected E., \nthose actions would include B .F. either aiding I.F. by intentionally taking concrete steps \nto assist her, or abetting I.F. by procuring the insulin pens, instructing her on how to \nuse them, and encouraging her to inject E. with a potentially fatal dose of insulin (p. \n101).  \n[83] In conside ring B.F.’s state of mind, the trial judge directed the jury to \nconsider all of the evidence, while also fairly reviewing some of the evidence that he \nsaw as relevant to this essential element (A.R., vol. I, at p. 102). The trial judge told the \njury that, on a review of this evidence, it needed to be satisfied that B.F. had the specific \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n intention to kill E. when she administered the noxious substance — either acting by \nherself, or as a joint principal, aider, or abettor — in order to return a verdict of gui lt \non the count of the attempted murder of E.

The jury was fully equipped to determine \nwhether the essential elements of the off ences were made out, including in a scenario \nin which it was I.F. and not B.F. who actually injected E. with insulin.  \n(3) The Trial Judge Adequately Summarized the Evidence Concerning the \nProcurement of the Insulin Pens  \n[85] B.F. contends that the trial judge’s ins tructions erroneously implied it was \nan established fact that she had procured the insulin pens from her workplace, despite \nthe evidence presented at trial to the contrary (A.F., at para. 65). I disagree.  \n[86] B.F. points out that, in describing the proceeding s below, the Court of \nAppeal said that it had been “established at trial that [B.F.] obtained the insulin pens \nfrom her place of employment, Trillium Health Partners, and that she knew how to \nadminister them” (see A.F., at para. 61, citing C.A. reasons, at  para. 11). While the \nwording of the Court of Appeal could have been more precise, this clearly refers to the \nfact that, in his sentencing reasons, the trial judge found that B.F. had taken the insulin \npens from her workplace (A.R., vol. I, at p. 2).  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n [87] It was open to the trial judge to make this supplementary finding, which \nwas necessary for sentencing purposes and not inconsistent with the jury’s verdict nor \nwith the evidence, in sentencing B.F. (see Criminal Code , s. 724(2)(b);  R. v. Ferguson , \n2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 21).  \n[88] In suggesting that the evidence does not support the judge’s finding, B.F. \nrelies on the testimony of an employee at Trillium Health Partners that the insulin pens \ncould have come from any one of their three hospitals, in cluding the hospital at which \nshe worked (A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 91 and 99). B.F. also refers to the evidence of her \nmanager at the relevant time, who stated that she was not aware of any insulin pens \ngoing missing from the unit where they worked together ( A.R., vol. V, at p. 101).  \n[89] However, this evidence does not preclude a finding that B.F. obtained the \ninsulin pens from her workplace. To the contrary, there was overwhelming \ncircumstantial evidence available to ground the trial judge’s finding for the purpo se of \nsentencing. The Crown is correct to point out, in particular, the evidence that the insulin \npens were stored unlocked and uncounted in a refrigerator at the nurses’ station, such \nthat B.F.’s manager would not have necessarily known if any had gone mi ssing from \nher unit (R.F., at para. 46; see A.R., vol. V, at pp. 81, 101 and 145).  \n[90] In any event, B.F. has not shown how the jury instructions were impacted \nby a factual finding drawn by the trial judge only after the jury had rendered its verdicts. \nContrary to B.F.’s assertion, the trial judge did not instruct the jury “as if that finding \nof fact was true” (A.F., at para. 65). The trial judge’s instructions specifically \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n mentioned that B.F. ’s manager  was unaware of any report of insulin pens going missing \nfrom her unit, and that various hospital staff had access to the pens (A.R., vol. I, at p. \n98). He also instructed the jury on the defence position that the Crown had not proven \nbeyond a reasonable d oubt that the insulin pens came from B.F.’s unit and that she had \ntaken the pens (p. 124).  \n[91] In summary, B.F. has not pointed to any error in the jury instructions that \njustifies appellate intervention.

Rather, they adequately summarized the \npertinent evidence at trial and rightly invited the jury to draw its own conclusion on the \nevidence.  \nVI. Disposition  \n[92] I would allow the Crown’s appeal and restore B.F.’s convictio n for the \nattempted murder of I.F. I would dismiss B.F.’s appeal.  \n The reasons of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis and Moreau JJ. were \ndelivered by  \n KARAKATSANIS AND MOREAU JJ.  —  \nI. Overview  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n [93] We agree with our colleague Justice O’Bonsawin’s reasons for dismissin g \nB.F.’s appeal from her convictions for the attempted murder and aggravated assault of \nher infant daughter E. However, we respectfully disagree with our colleague on the \nCrown appeal. We conclude that this appeal should be dismissed. A new trial is \nnecess ary on the charge of attempted murder of B.F.’s mother, I.F., under s. 239 of the \nCriminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C -46. \n[94] In our view, an air of reality existed at trial for the inference that B.F. \nprovided I.F. with insulin pens, which I.F. then independentl y and autonomously \nadministered to herself in a suicide attempt. It is therefore necessary for this Court to \ndetermine whether the jury needed instructions on how to apply the elements of \nattempted murder if it concluded that B.F. aided I.F.’s attempted su icide.  \n[95] Parliament has deliberately chosen to create separate offences of culpable \nhomicide (including murder) and aiding suicide. These offences carry different \nsentences and public stigma. Parliament has thus judged that aiding suicide carries \nlesser mora l blameworthiness than culpable homicide offences. To respect \nParliament’s choice, we hold that where an accused merely provides the victim with \nthe means of death, and the victim autonomously acts to kill themselves, the accused \nhas not performed the actus reus  for culpable homicide. In these cases, there is \ninsufficient legal causation between the accused’s acts and the victim’s death to assign \nthe accused the moral blameworthiness of a perpetrator of a homicide. Such an accused \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n cannot be convicted of any  culpable homicide offence, or of an inchoate offence such \nas attempted murder.  \n[96] We agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that since the jury received \nno instructions on the legal significance of finding that I.F. autonomously chose to \ninject herself with insulin, it is reasonably possible that the jury applied the incorrect \nlegal standard in assessing whether B.F. performed the actus reus  for attempted murder. \nWe would dismiss the Crown’s appeal.  \nII. Analysis  \n[97] The Crown’s appeal requires us to resolve two issues. First, whether there \nwas an air of reality to the theory that I.F. could have independently and autonomously \ninjected herself with the insulin in an attempt to commit suicide. Second, if the answer \nis yes, then we must determine the distinction bet ween the offences of culpable \nhomicide (and attempted murder) and aiding suicide, and whether the trial judge erred \nin failing to instruct the jury regarding the distinction between the different offences.  \nA. The Air of Reality as to I.F.’s Intention To Self -Inject  \n[98] We agree with Justice O’Bonsawin’s recitation of the facts and the judicial \nhistory. That said, we add that it is important to understand how the question of whether \nthere is an air of reality to the inference that I.F. injected herself with insulin  to end her \nown life came before this Court.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n [99] The trial judge, unprompted by counsel, posed questions at the pre -charge \nconference on whether the Crown’s alternative theory of culpability conflated the \nelements of attempted murder and aiding suicide.

Ultimately, while we do not have the benefit of any formal reasons on any \nfinding of whe ther there was an air of reality that I.F. chose to inject herself, it is clear \nfrom the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury that he decided not to provide any \nsuch instruction. He also told counsel that the facts in this case did not make out \n“counselling suicide” under s. 241 of the Criminal Code because, on either theory, B.F. \ndid more than just encourage I.F. to take her own life (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 115). The \nnext day, in going over the charge draft with counsel, he explained that when a pers on \ngives another the means to kill themselves, and explains how to accomplish that result, \nthe accused may be guilty of murder, even if the death could be described as a suicide \n(pp. 251 -52). \n[101]  The trial judge did not, however, indicate on the record whether  he thought \nthat providing I.F. with the means to take her own life (i.e., the insulin pens and \nsyringes) could have supported a conviction for aiding suicide under s. 241(1)(b).  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n [102]  Before this Court, the Crown argued, as our colleague would find, that \nsince there is no direct evidence that I.F. specifically intended to attempt suicide, the \njury needed no further instructions to properly consider the Crown’s alternative \npathway to culpability. B.F. submitted that because both parties at trial agreed there \nwas a realistic possibility that I.F. injected herself, there must also be a possibility that \nI.F. attempted suicide.  \n[103]  With respect for the contrary view, we agree with B.F. The evidence \npermitted a reasonable inference that I.F. chose to inject herself with in sulin that B.F. \nprovided. While this inference did not preclude a conviction for attempted murder, it \nrequired further jury instructions. The trial judge was right to raise this issue with \ncounsel at the pre -charge conference. Unfortunately, the trial judg e did not follow \nthrough on his intuition that I.F.’s choice to inject herself bears on B.F.’s culpability \nfor attempted murder.  \n(1) The Trial Judge’s Duty To Instruct the Jury  \n[104]  A trial judge has a positive duty to instruct the jury on “all relevant \nquestions of law that arise on the evidence”, whether or not a party has raised the issue \n(R. v. Pickton , 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 27). This duty arises most \ncommonly in the context of defences — a trial judge must instruct the jury on all \ndefences  available to an accused that have an air of reality, even defences that the \naccused does not rely on ( R. v. Cinous , 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 51; \nPappajohn v. The Queen , [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, at pp. 126 -27). \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n [105]  This duty to instruct also requir es the trial judge to explain the legal \nsignificance of other matters that have an air of reality (e.g., included offences; see R \nv. Pan , 2025 SCC 12). As Justice O’Bonsawin acknowledges, it is an error of law to \nomit any instruction the jury needs to prop erly undertake its task (para. 37).  \n[106]  Here, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider the theory that I.F. had \nin",

As Justice O’Bonsawin acknowledges, it is an error of law to \nomit any instruction the jury needs to prop erly undertake its task (para. 37).  \n[106]  Here, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider the theory that I.F. had \ninjected herself with insulin:  \nThe Crown may also discharge its onus with respect to this essential \nelement with proof beyond a reasonable d oubt that [B.F.] administered the \nsubstance to [I.F.] if she procured the insulin pen or pens and provided \nthem to [I.F.] with the intent that [I.F.] would use them to inject herself.  . . . \nIt does not matter if you find that [I.F.] was a willing participa nt in any or \nall of the actions undertaken by [B.F.].  \n \n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 106)  \nLater, the trial judge noted that I.F. could have been the one to inject B.F., E. and herself \nwith insulin. He reminded the jury that defence counsel had invited them to consi der \nthis theory:  \n[I.F.] was in the apartment and denies having done it. She is not trained but \nshe is much heavier than her daughter. She could have injected her \ndaughter, then [E.] and then herself. That is a possibility.  [Emphasis \nadded.]  \n \n(A.R., vol. I,  at p. 125)  \nThe trial judge then reminded the jury of the following Crown submission, which also \nrefers to the possibility that I.F. injected herself:  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n The Crown suggested that no witness ever suggested that [I.F.] had \noverpowered [B.F.] and done this. [B.F .] did not say that. Even if [I.F.] \nactually injected herself or [E.] , and the Crown did not suggest you reach \nthat conclusion, she told you that [B.F.] is still guilty. [Emphasis added.]  \n \n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 127)  \n[107]  On a plain reading of these instructions,  and as we will explain, it was open \nfor the jury to conclude that I.F. injected herself with insulin with the intent to die. \nContrary to the trial judge’s instructions, it did matter whether or not I.F. was a “willing \nparticipant”. The trial judge was obl iged to instruct the jury on all the consequences of \nthe Crown’s alternative theory that I.F. injected herself with insulin. In our view, this \nincludes the legal impact of a finding that I.F. chose to inject herself on the actus reus \nfor attempted murder. This is so despite neither party having explicitly argued to the \njury that I.F. intended to inject herself.  \n(2) The Air of Reality That Required a Jury Instruction in This Case  \n[108]  In the scenario where I.F. injected herself, B.F. would not have applied \nforce with out consent (i.e., committed an assault). However, B.F. arguably would still \nhave “administered” a noxious substance (insulin) and therefore committed the actus \nreus for attempted murder — carrying out some action to fulfill one’s intent to kill \nwhich went  beyond mere preparation ( R. v. Ancio , [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, at p. 247) . This \nscenario could explain the different verdicts on the attempted murder and aggravated \nassault of I.F. The jury could have had a reasonable doubt that B.F. physically injected \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n I.F., but still found that B.F. intended to cause I.F.’s death and took action by ensuring \nI.F. injected herself with a dangerous amount of insulin.  \n[109]  In this way, the Crown’s position reflects the air of reality of an inference \nthat I.F. may have chosen to injec t herself. Since it is not controversial that the \n“necessary factual inferences” ( Pan, at para. 52) to find that I.F. injected herself are \navailable on a reasonable view of the evidence here, the further inference that I.F. \nintended to inject herself to en d her own life is similarly available. In this case, the \nCrown advanced a theory of culpability based on the indirect administration of a \nnoxious substance. Specifically, they advanced the possibility that",

In this case, the \nCrown advanced a theory of culpability based on the indirect administration of a \nnoxious substance. Specifically, they advanced the possibility that I.F. self -\nadministered a drug that B.F. procured, prepared, and/or instructed on use. In doing so, \nthe Crown engaged the issue of I.F.’s personal autonomy to choose whether to inject \nherself, and thus commit suicide. The engagement of this issue had an impact on the \nelements of attempted murder. We are no t advancing the view that a finding of self -\nadministration of a noxious substance will be enough on its own to ground an air of \nreality to suicide in every case. As our colleague notes, a person may, for instance, self -\nadminister a substance without knowin g it would cause their death (para. 60). As with \nany other air of reality issue involving circumstantial evidence, the trier of fact must \nconduct a limited weighing of all the evidence to assess whether there is a realistic \npossibility that the person inte nded to die when they injected themselves with insulin \n(Pan, at paras. 64 -65). It will always be necessary to consider the surrounding \ncircumstances to determine if suicidal intent can be reasonably inferred from the self -\n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n administration of a lethal substan ce. However, it remains that the air of reality test \nsimply requires that the inference be reasonably available on the whole of the evidence.  \n[110]  Our colleague takes the view that the chain of inferences required to \nconclude that I.F. intended to die is so sp eculative as to be reasonably unavailable. She \nstates:  \nIn order to reasonably conclude that I.F. voluntarily attempted suicide on \nthis record, the jury would not only need to accept that I.F. self -\nadministered the insulin, but also conclude that the letter  was a suicide \nnote, and that it expressed I.F.’s suicidal intention. In this regard, the jury \nwould need to infer that B.F. accurately conveyed what I.F. dictated to her \nwhen writing the letter, and that it reflected I.F.’s views even though it was \nsigned  only by B.F., was written largely in past tense, and contained \nlanguage implying that B.F. was going to kill herself along with I.F. and \nE. This chain of inference is not reasonably open to a trier of fact on this \nrecord because it is tenuous and speculat ive. [Emphasis in original; para. \n65.] \n[111]  We disagree. Pan cautioned against such an approach of identifying an \ninference that seems, to the judge, more plausible than others, and then rejecting the \nless plausible inferences as unreasonable. It oversteps the limited role of a judge in \nassessing an air of reality with a low evidentiary threshold and involves the weighing \nof its substantive merits ( R. v. Pappas , 2013 SCC 56, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 452, at para. 22). \nYet, Pan emphasized that the purpose of setting the evidentiary bar low is to ensure \nthat all viable theorie s are presented to the jury.  Where, as a matter of common sense, \na viable theory is available on the evidence, it must be submitted for the jury’s \nthoughtful consideration in the absence of compelling reasons against doing so ( Pan, \nat para. 44; R. v. Osoli n, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 690).  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n [112]  In our view, considering the totality of the evidence before the jury, one of \nthe factual inferences the jury could have reasonably drawn is that I.F. intended to take \nher own life ( Pan, at paras. 64 -65). It is true tha t the defence did not argue at trial that \nI.F. intended to commit suicide that night or had previously expressed a suicidal \nideation. Further, Justice O’Bonsawin is correct that I.F. never testified that she \nintended to end her own life and that it would b e speculative to say that the “handwritten \nletter” evidences I.F.’s suicidal intent (paras. 61 -",

Further, Justice O’Bonsawin is correct that I.F. never testified that she \nintended to end her own life and that it would b e speculative to say that the “handwritten \nletter” evidences I.F.’s suicidal intent (paras. 61 -65). However, we agree with B.F. that \nthe circumstantial evidence in this case grounds an air of reality to the inference that \nI.F. injected herself intending to  commit suicide:  \n The apartment where B.F. and I.F. lived bore no signs of a struggle \nbetween them. The jury was told that “[I.F.] and [B.F.] were found \nlying side -by-side on the same bed .  . . with a pillow at or under their \nheads” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 83 ). While E. had nine injection site marks \non her thigh, there were no visible needle marks on either B.F. or I.F. \n(2024 ONCA 511, 439 C.C.C. (3d) 421,  at para. 12).  \n I.F. testified that she dictated to B.F. the contents of the handwritten \nletter found on th e TV stand, suggesting that she was the true author of \nwhat the Crown characterized as a suicide note. The letter stated in part, \n“[t]here will be no witnesses left to uncover the dirt that they do \nthrough Children’s Aid Society. Now they can be at peace” (A.R., vol. \nII, at p. 152).  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n  Crown counsel agreed at trial that there was an air of reality to the \ntheory that I.F. injected herself (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 91).  \n[113]  We also highlight that there is no direct evidence that B.F. deceived or \ncoerced I.F. into self-administering insulin. While this is not dispositive, taking a \ncommon -sense view of the evidence and accepting the legal maxim that people are \ngenerally presumed to intend the consequences of their actions ( R. v. Tatton , 2015 SCC \n33, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 5 74, at para. 27), it seems at least as likely that I.F. injected herself \nwith insulin intending to die as that she did so without that intent or was deceived or \ncoerced into injecting herself.  \n[114]  We also note that both parties agree there was an air of realit y to the defence \nposition at trial that I.F. was the sole perpetrator of the attempted murder of E.: that she \ninjected E., B.F., and then herself. This is important context for assessing what factual \ninferences the jury could draw from the evidence that un derpins both charges. If there \nis an air of reality to the theory that I.F. intended to kill E., B.F., and then herself in the \ncontext of the attempted murder of E., then there must also be an air of reality to the \ntheory that I.F. intended to inject herse lf to bring about her own death.  \n[115]  Furthermore, it is evident from the verdicts that the jury did consider \nwhether I.F. injected herself with insulin. The jury was specifically instructed that it \ncould only find B.F. guilty of aggravated assault (or the inc luded offence of assault) if \nit found that B.F. actually injected I.F. (i.e., the application of force without consent). \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n \n As the trial judge said in his final instructions, “[g]iving them a bat to hit themselves \nwith is also not an assault” (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 321). The jury acquitted B.F. of \naggravated assault of I.F. We can infer from this verdict that the jury had a reasonable \ndoubt about whether B.F. physically injected I.F. And given the Crown’s alternative \ntheory, we can also infer that the jury foun d beyond a reasonable doubt that B.F. \n“administered” the insulin by procuring it, instructing on how to use the syringe, and/or \npreparing the dose for I.F. to inject herself.

This \nscenario directly impacted on the alleged actus reus  for attempted murder. For that \nreason, the trial judge was required to instruct the jury, regarding the attempted murder \nof I.F., on the legal significance of finding that I .F. willingly injected herself.  \n(3) Procedure for Addressing Future Air of Reality Issues  \n[117]  We emphasize that in a case such as this where the trial judge raises an air \nof reality question on their own motion, it is best practice to solicit submissions from \ncounsel and provide reasons for decision. Here, submissions and reasons would have \naddressed the impact of I.F.’s alleged choice to inject herself on the jury instructions \nfor attempted murder. This would have afforded both the Crown and the defence a \ngreater  opportunity to marshal the evidence and the law necessary to address the trial \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n \n judge’s concern. While it may be possible, as the Court of Appeal for Ontario did in R. \nv. Suthakaran , 2024 ONCA 50, 433 C.C.C. (3d) 175, to glean a trial judge’s thinking \nfrom  the pre -charge conference transcript, formal submissions and reasons create a \nclearer record for appellate review. As the court noted in Suthakaran , “[i]n determining \nthis ground of appeal, it is helpful to have an understanding of the trial judge’s reaso ns \nfor leaving the defence of a third party with the jury and for providing the instructions \nthat he did” (para. 21).  \n[118]  We turn now to the main question on appeal.  \nB. The Distinction Between Aiding Suicide and Culpable Homicide  \n[119]  The distinction between the offen ces of aiding suicide and culpable \nhomicide has been a feature of our criminal law since 1892. This country’s first \nCriminal Code, 1892 , S.C. 1892, c. 29, set out the offences of culpable homicide (at \nthat time murder and manslaughter; see ss. 218, 220 and  227 to 230), and the offences \nof attempting suicide and aiding suicide (ss. 237 and 238). This was a departure from \nthe common law, which had considered suicide to be a form of homicide, so that those \nwho aided suicide could also be guilty of murder (see,  e.g., W. Blackstone, \nCommentaries on the Laws of England  (8th ed. 1769), Book IV, at pp. 35 -36 and 188 -\n90). Because suicide itself was not made an offence, those who aided suicide could not \nbe a party to murder. Therefore, a separate offence was required to establish criminal \nliability for aiding a suicide. Today, while the offence of attempted suicide has been \nrepealed, the distinction between culpable homicide and aiding suicide remains.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n [120]  Under the current Criminal Code , while there are certain exceptions  \navailable under Canada’s medical assistance in dying (MAID) regime (see s. 241(2) to \n(7); ss. 241.1 to 241.4), aiding suicide remains an indictable offence punishable by up \nto 14 years’ incarceration. Although both culpable homicide and aiding suicide are  \nserious offences, Parliament has chosen to keep them distinct, with differing elements \nand levels of moral culpability. Aiding suicide has a lesser, though still serious, \nmaximum punishment than culpable homicide, which is punishable by life \nimprisonment (ss. 235 and 236).  \n[121]  In some cases, the distinction between these different offences will be \nobvious. However, where a reasonable inference that can be drawn from the record is \nthat the other person contributed to their own death, and the acts of the accused  could \nbe characterized",

However, where a reasonable inference that can be drawn from the record is \nthat the other person contributed to their own death, and the acts of the accused  could \nbe characterized as a contributing cause of death (for example, by providing the means \nof death), the legal distinction between the two offences must be identified and \nexplained to the jury in order to respect and give effect to the distinction draw n by \nParliament.  \n(1) Elements of Culpable Homicide  \n[122]  There are three culpable homicide offences in the Criminal Code : murder \n(s. 229); manslaughter (s. 234); and infanticide (s. 233).   \n[123]  For all homicide offences , the actus reus  is “the causing of the death of a \nhuman being” (K. Roach, Criminal Law  (8th ed. 2022), at p. 442; see Criminal Code , \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n s. 222(1) and (5)). Section 222(5) sets out the circumstances where such actions qualify \nas a culpable  homicide and therefore an offence u nder the Criminal Code . For example, \nwhere an accused causes the death of a victim by way of an unlawful act, that killing \nconstitutes the actus reus  for culpable homicide .  \n[124]  The mens rea  for murder requires that the accused intend to kill the victim, \nor intend to cause the victim bodily harm that they know is likely to cause death and is \nreckless as to whether death ensues ( Criminal Code , s. 229(a)). Proof of subjective \nforesight is required for murder ( R. v. Martineau , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at pp. 645 -46).  \n[125]  B.F. was charged with the attempted murder of I.F. Attempted murder is a \nform of inchoate culpable homicide.  The mens rea for attempted murder requires \nspecific intent — the accused must have intended to kill the victim ( Ancio , at p. 249; \nRoach, at pp. 153-55). The actus reus for attempted murder requires that the accused \nmust have carried out some action to fulfill the intent to cause death which went beyond \nmerely preparatory steps (see Ancio , at p. 247; United States of America v. Dynar , \n[1997] 2 S.C. R. 462, at para. 50).  \n[126]  Because the actus reus of culpable homicide, in all its different forms, is \ncausing the death of another, causation will be a key issue when assessing actus reus . \nCausation is generally not a contentious issue where an unlawful act i s combined with \nthe required mens rea for the offence charged ( R. v.  Nette , 2001 SCC 78, [2001] 3 \nS.C.R. 488, at para. 47). However, where it is less clear what acts caused the death, \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n \n causation can be more controversial (G. Williams, “Causation in Homicide ”, [1957] \nCrim. L.R.  429, at p.  510).  \n[127]  In Nette , this Court confirmed that there is one applicable standard of \ncausation for all forms of culpable homicide, which asks whether the actions of the \naccused were a significant contributing cause of death (para. 71). This standard requires \nproof of both factual and legal causation. Factual causation is met when the accused’s \nactions are a “[b]ut for” cause of the victim’s death ( R. v. Maybin , 2012 SCC 24, [2012] \n2 S.C.R. 30, at para. 15). Legal causation is concer ned with concepts of moral \nresponsibility: “ . . . the inquiry is directed at the question of whether the accused person \nshould be held criminally responsible for the consequences that occurred” ( Nette , at \npara. 45; Maybin , at para. 16). This is a separate consideration from mens rea  (Nette , \n",

This is a separate consideration from mens rea  (Nette , \nat para. 47).  \n[128]  In some cases, more than one person or factor may contribute to causing \ndeath. However, this will not necessarily preclude proving that the accused met the \nlegal causation standard for culpable homicide ( Nette , at para. 77; Maybin , at para. 29). \nOur law recognizes that an individual need not be the sole cause of death to be guilty \nof a culpable homicide offence. Therefore, intervening acts will not always break the \nchain of legal causation and absolve the accused of moral blameworthiness for the \ndeath ( Maybin , at paras. 28 -29). \n(2) Distinguishing Culpable Homicide From Aiding Suicide  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n \n [129]  Section 241(1) of the Criminal Code  sets out three modes of carrying out \nthe offence of “counselling or aiding” suicide: counsell ing, abetting, and aiding. This \nCourt has not definitively set out the elements of aiding suicide. However, this Court \nhas defined the actus reus of the general mode of liability of “aiding” as doing \nsomething or omitting to do something to assist or help another to commit an offence. \nThe mens rea  requires the aider’s knowledge that a principal intends to commit an \noffence, and the aider’s intent to assist the principal in so doing ( R. v. Briscoe , 2010 \nSCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at paras. 14 -18; see also Criminal Code , s. 21(1)(b)). By \nanalogy, providing an individual with the means to commit suicide, with knowledge \nthat the individual intends to commit suicide and intending to help them commit \nsuicide, would appear to establish the offence of aiding suici de.   \n[130]  When an accused has provided a person with the means to take their own \nlife, and that person makes an independent and autonomous choice to take their own \nlife, the question is how to distinguish between the offences of culpable homicide and \naiding su icide.  \n[131]  Here, B.F. was not charged with aiding suicide. The trial judge told the jury \nthat it could find that the actus reus of attempted murder had been established in one \nof two ways: either by B.F. actually injecting I.F. with the insulin, or by B.F. sim ply \nproviding I.F. with the insulin pens with the intent that I.F. would use them to inject \nherself (A.R., vol. I, at p. 106). In this respect, the trial judge stated that “[i]t does not \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n \n matter if you find that [I.F.] was a willing participant in any or al l of the actions \nundertaken by [B.F.]” (p. 106).  \n[132]  The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred by failing to distinguish \nbetween the mens rea  and actus reus of attempted murder and aiding suicide (see paras. \n45-58). Writing for the court, George J.A.  held that when an accused provides another \nindividual with the means to commit suicide, knowing they would do so, the key issue \nis “whether the accused, either through manipulation or intimidation (or by other \nmeans), overbore the victim’s freewill in cho osing suicide” (para. 44). George J.A. \nconcluded the trial judge’s failure to explain this distinction to the jury meant that the \njury could have found that B.F.’s actions constituted attempted murder, even if those \nactions instead constituted aiding suici de. The jury charge blurred the line between the \ntwo offences. A new trial was required (para. 66).  \n[133]  The Crown submits that there was no error in the jury charge, and that the \nCourt of Appeal erred by modifying the causation test for culpable homicide with the \nnovel requirement that the victim’s free will must have been overborne.

A new trial was required (para. 66).  \n[133]  The Crown submits that there was no error in the jury charge, and that the \nCourt of Appeal erred by modifying the causation test for culpable homicide with the \nnovel requirement that the victim’s free will must have been overborne. The Crown \nsays this requirement artificially focuses on the final act in the chain of causation, \ncontrary to this Court’s jurisprudence regarding causation in homicide cases (A.F.,  at \nparas. 5 -6). This, the Crown contends, imposes a “bright line” rule which breaks \ncausation in particular cases, thus lacking the contextual nuance of causation as \nestablished by this Court. Instead, the Crown argues that the test for causation set out \nby this Court’s jurisprudence is nuanced and flexible enough to distinguish between \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n the different offences (A.F., at paras. 69 -74 and 100). This position is supported by the \nintervener Inclusion Canada, who submits that the Crown’s approach better protects  \nvulnerable individuals who are living with disabilities.  \n[134]  The difficulty with the Crown’s approach is that it subsumes the conduct \nfor aiding suicide within culpable homicide, without distinguishing the offences’ \ndifferent levels of moral blameworthiness. Potential liability is neither clear nor \npredictable. If t he Crown’s position is accepted, then there could be cases where an \naccused is found guilty of culpable homicide because their actions were a significant \ncontributing cause of death, even though they knowingly provided the deceased with \nthe means to carry out an autonomous and independent decision to take their own life \n— which is itself not a crime.  \n[135]  In our view, such a result does not respect the legal distinction Parliament \nintended in creating two distinct crimes. It does not identify where or how the l egal line \nis drawn between two offences, which reflect different levels of moral \nblameworthiness. Moral blameworthiness is a sacrosanct principle of the legal system \ndesigned to avoid convicting the morally innocent ( R. v. Bernard , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, \nat p. 843; R. v. Brown , 2022 SCC 18, [2022] 1 S.C.R. 374, at para. 24; Re B.C. Motor \nVehicle Act , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 513 -14). Recognized as a constitutionally \nprotected principle of fundamental justice, the moral blameworthiness requirement \n“maintain [s] a proportionality between the stigma and punishment attached to a murder \nconviction and the moral blameworthiness of the offender” ( Martineau , at p. 646). \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n Thus, different offences can attract differing levels of moral blameworthiness. This \nCourt has al ready recognized, for example, that a murder conviction attracts a higher \nlevel of stigma and heightened punishment than a manslaughter conviction ( Martineau , \nat p. 645; R. v. Creighton , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3). Within this context of differing levels of \nmoral blameworthiness between criminal offences, and to respect Parliament’s \nintention to create two crimes, it is necessary to identify the legal distinction in the \nelements of the offences of aiding suicide and culpable homicide  — here, attempted \nmurder.  \n[136]  This distinction may, sometimes, be reflected in the mens rea , such that the \naccused does not have the specific intent required to establish the mens rea for \nattempted murder. But the difference between any culpable homicide and aiding \nsuicide must also be refl ected in the actus reus . The legal analysis must identify in what \ncircumstances actions will meet the actus reus  of culpable homicide, as opposed to \naiding suicide. Under both offences, the accused’s actions may factually be a \ncontributing cause of the dea th. The analysis must set out the nature of the accused’s \nactions that moved from aiding suicide to murder, or attempted murder. In our view, \nthe issue arises squarely in the context of legal causation when establishing the actus \nreus.  \n[137]  Legal causation is an assessment of moral blamew",

The analysis must set out the nature of the accused’s \nactions that moved from aiding suicide to murder, or attempted murder. In our view, \nthe issue arises squarely in the context of legal causation when establishing the actus \nreus.  \n[137]  Legal causation is an assessment of moral blameworthiness and whether \nthe accused should be held criminally responsible for the consequences of their actions, \nespecially when there are other contributing causes of death. In this respect, we agree \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n with the Crown’s position th at the law of causation of homicide is sufficiently flexible \nto respond to circumstances wher e it is not immediately clear whether the accused’s \nactions constituted homicide or aiding suicide (see A.F., at paras. 74 and 99 -100). The \nlaw of causation has al ways been contextual and able to respond to differing levels of \nmoral culpability.  \n[138]  For example, in R. v. Harbottle , [1993] 3 S.C.R. 306, this Court held that \nconstructive first degree murder under s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code , wherein “death \nis caused” by an accused “while committing or attempting to commit” certain offences, \nrequires a higher standard of causation due to the gravity of the offence and the severity \nof the sentence (p. 323; see also Nette , at para. 65). For an accused to be guilty under \nthat provision, their actions must be “a substantial and integral cause of the death” \n(Harbottle , at pp. 323 -24). Thus, while legal causation focuses on an accused’s actions \nrather than their intentions, it is still focused on whether the accused is sufficiently \nmorally blameworthy to deserve the heightened stigma and punishment of a particular \ncriminal offence.  \n[139]  In addition, legal causation can consider the issue of when an intervening \nact can break the chain of causation. Maybin  recognized that court s may assess \nintervening acts using different methods. For example, the “reasonable foreseeability \napproach” asks whether the general nature of the intervening act was reasonably \nforeseeable when the accused committed their actions (para. 26). In turn, the  \n“independent intervening act” approach asks whether the intervening act was an \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n independent factor which severed the impact of the accused’s actions, making the \nintervening act the sole cause of death, or whether the intervening act was triggered or \nprovok ed by the accused’s actions (para. 27). This Court was also clear in that decision \nthat both of these approaches are simply analytical aids, and are not necessarily \ndeterminative. At all times, the focus of the inquiry remains on whether the accused’s \nactions were a significant contributing cause of death, and therefore whether the \naccused ought to be held legally responsible for their actions under the charged offence \nin a normative sense (paras. 28 -29). \n[140]  The Crown’s alternative theory in this case was that  I.F. injected herself \nwith insulin B.F. provided. On that theory, B.F.’s acts may not be sufficiently morally \nblameworthy to be convicted of the attempted murder of I.F., but could be sufficiently \nmorally blameworthy to be convicted for aiding her suicide . Thus, addressing legal \ncausation requires a more specific inquiry where the alleged victim sought to commit \nsuicide. It requires an adaptation of the principles from Maybin . Questions of \nreasonable foreseeability or whether an accused’s acts trigger inde pendent acts \ninsufficiently respond to the distinction between suicide and homicide. These questions \ncould lead to the conclusion that an individual’s suicide was reasonably foreseeable \nwhen the accused provided them with the means to die by suicide, or th at the suicide \nwas factually triggered by the accused’s provision of the means and was not an \nindependent intervening act which severed the chain of causation. But such conclusions \nwould fail to grapple with the normative distinction between killing a pers on, and \nassisting a person who decides to end their own life.  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n [141]  Instead, where the deceased took their own life autonomously and of their \nown free will, this independent choice to act to cause their own death may sever the \naccused’s legal causation.

Those c ircumstances reduce the accused’s moral \nblameworthiness, and do not establish legal causation for culpable homicide. The \naccused’s actions will therefore not be a significant contributing cause of death, and an \nacquittal for any culpable homicide charge sh ould follow. But depending on the nature \nand extent of the accused’s actions, they may be liable for aiding suicide under s. 241(1) \nof the Criminal Code .  \n[142]  But where the accused’s actions somehow actively undermined or \noverpowered the deceased’s autonomous choice whether to commit suicide, then the \nsuicide may no longer qualify as an independent intervening act, and causation for \nhomicide may be established. For example, where the accused manipulates or induces \nthe deceased into taking their own life, such t hat the deceased’s actions can no longer \nbe seen as a fully autonomous and independent choice, the accused’s participation in \nthe suicide may rise to the level of culpable homicide. Thus, encouraging a person \nknown to be vulnerable to take their own life, and proactively giving them the means \nto do so, could potentially make an individual a significant contributing cause of the \nother person’s death.  \n[143]  This is not, as the Crown contends, an entirely new standard of causation \n(A.F., at paras. 73 -75). The same standards and principles of causation, as established \nin Smithers v. The Queen , [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, Nette , and Harbottle , continue to apply, \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n \n although adapted to unique factual circumstances. Moreover, we would not accept the \nCrown’s argument that this ana lysis inappropriately re -centres the causation and actus \nreus analysis in homicide cases around the mental state of the victim — something it \nargues is unprecedented and unworkable in practice (A.F., at paras. 79 -81). Such \nconsiderations are not new, and a re already part of the actus reus of other offences in \nthe Criminal Code . For example, the actus reus of sexual assault is established when \nthe accused touches the complainant in a sexual manner, without the complainant’s \nconsent. The absence of consent is  determined by “ reference to the complainant’s \nsubjective internal state of mind  towards the touching, at the time it occurred” ( R. v. \nEwanchuk , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at para. 26; see also R. v. G.F. , 2021 SCC 20, [2021] \n1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 29).  \n[144]  In addit ion, it is unnecessary  to require , as B.F. urges us, that the \ndifferentiation between suicide and homicide  be resolved at the outset of the analysis, \nbefore any assessment of actus reus or mens rea . While B.F. argues that the distinction \nbetween suicide and homicide is clear, and that a suicide simply cannot ground liability \nfor homicide due to its distinction from homicide, we do not accept that the distinction \nwill always be obvious.  \n[145]  This said, w e agree with B.F. and the interveners that the key question is \nwhether there was a suicide (or attempt suicide) (see R.F. , at paras. 64 -65; I.F. , Attorney \nGeneral of Canada,  at paras. 2 -3; I.F. , Canadian Civil Liberties Association,  at paras. \n2-3). But we view this question as properly being addressed as part of the legal \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n \n causation analysis. A s the Court of Appeal recognized, this question requires an \nassessment of  whether someone independently and autonomously intended to cause \ntheir own death, decided to act on that intention, and carried out the acts that would \nresult in their own death.

In such circumstances the actus reus  of culpable homicide \noffences must account  for the possibility that the accused’s acts were simply to aid \nanother’s suicide. However,  when those acts go beyond “aiding”  such that they actively \nundermine or overbear the independence of another’s choice  to commit suicide, then \nthe accused may be guilty of culpable homicide. The key consideration is whether the \naccused’s acts contributed t o the death  in such a way that it is no longer correct to \ncharacterize the death as an independent autonomous choice that breaks the chain of \ncausation and absolves the accused  of moral blameworthiness . \n[146]  Finally, we do not accept the Crown’s alternative submission, which \nsuggests that once an unlawful act is proven to have been a significant contributing \ncause of death, then a new partial defence of assisted suicide should be recognized. \nThis defence would ask what steps the accused took to determine whet her the \ndeceased’s choice to take their own life was independent and autonomous. Should the \npartial defence be made out, the accused would not be liable for culpable homicide.  \nHowever, creating a new defence removes the analysis from its appropriate place in \nhomicide cases — legal causation, which assesses the accused’s moral culpability.  \nC. Application: Instructing on Actus Reus for Attempted Murder  \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n \n [147]  Here, given the air of reality to the theory of the case that I.F. injected \nherself with insulin with the inte nt to commit suicide, the trial judge was wrong to \nsuggest that that I.F.’s willing participation in the injection of insulin would be \nirrelevant. Once the scenario that I.F. may have willingly and autonomously injected \nherself with the insulin procured by  B.F. was put to the jury, the trial judge had to \ninstruct the jury as to whether I.F.’s choice  to inject herself with insulin had severed \nthe chain of causation, such that B.F. would no longer have been a significant \ncontributing cause of I.F.’s death.  \n[148]  It was incumbent upon the trial judge to make the distinction between \nattempted murder and aiding suicide clear to the jury. Otherwise, there was a risk that \nB.F. would be found guilty of attempted murder, despite her moral blameworthiness \nnot rising to the  level of that offence. To maintain the distinction between aiding suicide \nand attempted murder, the trial judge should have instructed the jury that if it concluded \nthat B.F.  performed actions to carry out her intent to kill, namely “administered a \nnoxiou s substance” by way of I.F. injecting herself with insulin, it should then consider \nwhether I.F.’s choice to inject herself was independent and autonomous, or whether \nB.F.’s acts undermined or overtook the independence of I.F.’s choice. The jury should \nhave been instructed that if it found that I.F.’s choice was independent and autonomous, \nthen it should acquit B.F. of attempted murder.  \n[149]  Since there existed an air of reality to the theory of the case whereby B.F. \naided I.F.’s attempted suicide, it was an err or of law for the trial judge not to instruct \n2025 SCC 41 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n \n the jury on the legal significance of this finding to the actus reus analysis of attempted \nmurder ( R. v.
