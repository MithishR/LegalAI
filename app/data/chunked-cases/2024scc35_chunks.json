    "text": " 1985, \nc. C-46, s.  535 — Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-21, ss.  43, 44 . \n In unrelated cases, A and G were accused of one or more historical sexual \noffences against a child, which at the time of their commission carried a maximum term \nof imprisonment of 10 years. After the  dates of the alleged offences and before charges \nwere laid, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to \n14 years’ imprisonment. A and G first appeared in the Court of Québec in the summer \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n of 2019. At first appearance, they reserv ed or postponed their right to elect their mode \nof trial to a later date. Then, in 2020, A and G each requested a preliminary inquiry. \nHowever, under an amendment to s.  535 of the Criminal Code  that came into force on \nSeptember 19, 2019, the availability o f preliminary inquiries was now restricted to \naccused persons charged with offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more \nof imprisonment. In both matters, the Crown argued that the court lacked jurisdiction \nunder the new s.  535 to hold a preliminary inquiry.  \n The Court of Québec held that the new s.  535 applied to A and G and that \nit lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. In its view, preliminary \ninquiries are of a purely procedural nature, and applying the new rule did not impac t \nthe substantive rights of A and G. A and G each challenged that interpretation. A \nSuperior Court judge dismissed A’s challenge, characterizing the right to a preliminary \ninquiry as purely procedural and concluding that the new s.  535 required the accused  \nto be charged with an offence for which they could be personally punishable by \n14 years’ imprisonment or more. A different Superior Court judge dismissed G’s \nchallenge, holding that preliminary inquiries affected the substantive right to a \ndischarge but t hat G’s entitlement had not vested by the time the new s.  535 came into \nforce — to get the benefit of the old rule, he should have both elected his mode of trial \nand asked for a preliminary inquiry before September 19, 2019.  \n The Court of Appeal concluded that the new rule in s.  535 did not apply to \nA and G and that they had a vested right to preliminary inquiries. Relying on the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n principle of legality, the Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry \naccrues at two different points in time: it is accruing from the moment the offence is \ncommitted, and it is vested or accrued at the date of the first appearance. Given its \nconclusion on the vested right, the Court of Appeal did not address the question of how \nthe amended version of s.  535 should  be interpreted. The Court of Appeal remitted each \nfile to the Court of Québec for a preliminary inquiry.  \n Held (Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis, O’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ. \ndissenting) : The appeal should be dismissed.  \n1. Temporal Application of the New Section  535 of the Criminal Code  \n Per Wagner  C.J. and Karakatsanis, O’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ.:  There is \nno clear basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliament’s specific intention, so \nthe new limitation in s. 535 should apply unless it interferes with a s ubstantive legal \ninterest that had vested before it came into force. The amendment to s. 535 is not purely \nprocedural because it can interfere with a substantive legal interest by depriving an \naccused of the opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary in quiry. However, that \nsubstantive legal interest only vests at the time a request for a preliminary inquiry is \nmade. Accordingly, the new limitation in s. 535 should apply to all persons where a \nrequest for a preliminary inquiry was not made before Septembe r 19, 2019.  \n Per Kasirer and Jamal  JJ.: Because the right to a preliminary inquiry is not \npurely procedural, the new s.  535 does not apply with immediate effect. Where a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n request for a preliminary inquiry was made before September 19, 2019, the right to an \ninquiry vested.

    "text": " r 19, 2019.  \n Per Kasirer and Jamal  JJ.: Because the right to a preliminary inquiry is not \npurely procedural, the new s.  535 does not apply with immediate effect. Where a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n request for a preliminary inquiry was made before September 19, 2019, the right to an \ninquiry vested. However, this is not the only situation in which the right to request a \npreliminary inquiry vests; this right also vests each time a court agrees to reserve an \naccused’s right to elect their mode of trial.  \n Per Côté and Rowe  JJ.: The amendm ent made to s.  535 is procedural in \nnature but affects a substantive right, that is, an accused’s right to be discharged of any \ncharge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no \nsufficient case is made out to put the accuse d on trial on the charge. Consequently, the \npresumption that Parliament did not intend to interfere with vested rights or privileges \nin relation to preliminary inquiries applies. The right to a preliminary inquiry vests at \nthe time charges are laid. The fo rmer s.  535 should therefore continue to apply to \npersons charged prior to September 19, 2019.  \n Per Martin  J.: The amendment to s.  535 affects an accused’s substantive \nlegal interests. Accordingly, the new s.  535 must apply prospectively only. Persons \nalleged to have committed an offence before September 19, 2019, that rendered them \neligible for a preliminary inquiry should retain that eligibility today.  \n2. Interpretation of the New Section  535 of the Criminal Code  \n Per Wagner  C.J. and  Karakatsanis, Martin,  O’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ.: \nThe new rule in s.  535 requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years’ \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n imprisonment in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary \ninquiry to be available.  \n Per Côté and Rowe  JJ.: Under the new s.  535, an accused has the right to \na preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by \n14 years or more of imprisonment; this right is not affected by the accused’s right to \nthe benefit of the lesser punishmen t. Where the maximum sentence for an offence was \nincreased to 14  years between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, \na preliminary inquiry can be held even if the accused is not personally facing a \nmaximum sentence of 14  years.  \n Per Kasirer and Jamal  JJ.: The question of the interpretation of the new \ns. 535 is not addressed.  \n ____________________________  \n Per Côté  and Rowe  JJ.: The starting point in analyzing the temporal \napplication of new legislation is always the legislation itself. In  the absence of a \ntransitional provision, and where the lawmaker’s intention to give the legislation a \nparticular effect does not appear expressly or by necessary implication upon reading \nthe legislation, as is the case with the new s.  535, recourse must b e had specifically to \nthe rules laid down in interpretation statutes and court decisions. Three well -established \nprinciples of transitional law come into play: (1)  the principle of legality; (2)  the \npresumption against interference with vested rights; and (3) the exception based on the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n immediate application of purely procedural provisions. The principle of legality is a \npillar of the criminal law whose purpose is to preserve the law as it stood at the time an \noffence was committed. The new legislation canno t make criminal any act or omission \nthat did not constitute an offence at the time it occurred. In addition, the new legislation \ncannot create more severe punishments for an offence committed before it came into \nforce. Next, the presumption that the lawmak er does not intend to interfere with vested \nrights or privileges is one of the fundamental principles of transitional law. To ensure \nthe certainty of the legal consequences attaching to facts and conduct predating a \nlegislative amendment, a statute should not be given a construction that would impair \nexisting rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched \nrequires such a construction. Legislation that affects substantive rights can only apply \nprospectively to cases in respec t of which these rights have not yet vested. There is one \nexception to this presumption: purely procedural legislation, which is",

To ensure \nthe certainty of the legal consequences attaching to facts and conduct predating a \nlegislative amendment, a statute should not be given a construction that would impair \nexisting rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched \nrequires such a construction. Legislation that affects substantive rights can only apply \nprospectively to cases in respec t of which these rights have not yet vested. There is one \nexception to this presumption: purely procedural legislation, which is meant to govern \nthe manner in which rights or privileges are asserted without affecting their substance, \nis presumed to apply i mmediately. Sections  43 and 44 of the federal Interpretation Act  \ncodify the presumption against interference with vested rights and the exception based \non the immediate application of purely procedural provisions.  \n The abolition of the preliminary inquiry for certain offences does not \nengage the principle of legality. This measure has no impact on the scope of criminal \nliability. The preliminary inquiry is not a legal rule on which accused persons may rely \nin adjusting their behaviour or in deciding to acce pt the consequences of breaking it at \nthe time of committing an offence. However, the absence of any indication from \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n Parliament as to the temporal application of s.  535 triggers the presumption that the \nlegislative amendment does not affect vested rights o r privileges. There is agreement \nfor the most part with Karakatsanis  J.’s analysis with respect to the nature of the \nabolition of the preliminary inquiry for accused persons charged with an indictable \noffence punishable by less than 14 years of imprisonmen t: the legislative amendment \ncannot be considered a purely procedural amendment. It does not affect only the \nmanner of proceeding or of conducting litigation; the limitation on the right to a \npreliminary inquiry has a direct impact on the liberty and secur ity of accused persons. \nIt is therefore procedural in nature, but it affects a substantive right. Because the \namendment is not purely procedural in nature, the new enactment does not apply \nimmediately to all proceedings. Moreover, the fact that new procedu ral legislation may, \nthrough its effects, interfere with a substantive right does not end the analysis: the right \nor privilege in question must also have been vested at the time that legislation came \ninto force.  \n An individual claiming a vested right or privilege must satisfy a two -step \ntest. First, the individual’s legal situation must be tangible and concrete rather than \ngeneral and abstract. Second, the individual’s legal situation must be sufficiently \ntangible and constituted at the time the new legis lation comes into force; in other words, \nthe situation must have materialized to some degree. In this case, at the first step, the \npossibility that the accused’s right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time the offence \nis committed can be excluded: the  accused’s legal situation is not sufficiently tangible, \nconcrete and distinctive at that time. It is not until charges are laid against the accused \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n \n that the criminal court process begins and the accused’s legal situation becomes \ntangible, concrete and dis tinctive.  \n Next, under the second step, the accused’s situation is sufficiently \nconstituted at the time charges are laid. At that point, the vesting of the right is certain \nand not conditional on future events, because the accused will inevitably have to a ppear \nand choose to exercise or waive their right to a preliminary inquiry, or reserve their \nelection. All of the conditions precedent to the vesting of the right are also fulfilled at \nthat time. The request that the accused must make for a preliminary inq uiry has no \neffect on the crystallization of the vested right. Section  535 opens with the phrase “if \nan accused who is charged with an indictable offence”, which sets the charging of the \naccused as the condition for entitlement to a preliminary inquiry. Th e request triggers \nthe justice’s duty to conduct a preliminary inquiry, but it is not a condition precedent \nto the existence of the right to a preliminary inquiry itself; rather, it constitutes the \nexercise of the right itself.  \n With regard to the interpre tation that the new s. 535 should receive, its text, \ncontext and purpose demonstrate that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry \nif their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of \nimprisonment. There is no ambiguity in the wording of s.  535: a preliminary inquiry \ncan be held only in the case of an “accused who is charged with an indictable offence \nthat is punishable by 14 years or more",

    "text": " the new s. 535 should receive, its text, \ncontext and purpose demonstrate that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry \nif their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of \nimprisonment. There is no ambiguity in the wording of s.  535: a preliminary inquiry \ncan be held only in the case of an “accused who is charged with an indictable offence \nthat is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment”. Both the adjective \n“punishable” in English and its equi valent “ passible ” in the French version relate to the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n indictable offence and not to the sentence the accused may receive. This phrasing refers \nto the seriousness of the alleged offence, and its logic is not directed at the accused \npersonally. Parliament th us intended the right to a preliminary inquiry to be tied to the \nseriousness of the alleged offence, not to the degree of jeopardy faced by the accused; \nthis is an objective criterion. This interpretation is also reinforced by an examination of \nthe parliam entary debates that led to the amendment in issue.  \n The jeopardy actually faced by the accused as a result of the time when the \noffence was committed is part of the accused’s individual circumstances and does not \ngo to the seriousness of the alleged offenc e. An offence is not less serious today because \nit was committed before a certain date. In determining the right to a preliminary inquiry, \nParliament did not intend to draw a distinction between charges of the same nature \nbased on the date of commission of  the offence. The objective seriousness of an offence \nis not confined to the maximum sentence for the offence at the time it was committed. \nOn the contrary, the legislative amendments increasing maximum sentences indicate \nParliament’s determination that of fences are to be treated as more grave than they had \nbeen in the past. Accordingly, where the maximum sentence for  an offence was \nincreased to 14 years between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, \na preliminary inquiry can be held even if the accused is not per sonally facing a sentence \nof 14 years. In such a case, it must be asked whether the seriousness of the alleged \noffence, as it is defined today, places it within the category of the most serious offences. \nThe fact that the accused i s charged and convicted on the basis of the criminal \nprovisions in force at the time the offence was committed changes nothing in this \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n \n regard. Although an accused may receive a reduced maximum sentence for a crime \ncommitted before the sentence was increase d, the accused’s right to the benefit of the \nlesser punishment does not defeat the right to a preliminary inquiry; to conclude \notherwise would lead to an absurd result, penalize the accused and disregard the \nsequence of stages in a criminal trial.  \n In this  case, A and G had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, since this \nright crystallizes at the time charges are laid. Moreover, regardless of whether a right \nvested in A and G before the legislative amendment came into force, they have such a \nright under  the current version of s.  535, because the acts in question would be \npunishable by a max imum term of imprisonment of 14 years  if they were committed \ntoday . The appeal should be dismissed.  \n Per Kasirer  and Jamal  JJ.: There is agreement, in substance, with \nKarakatsanis  J.’s analysis of vested rights with regard to the temporal application of \ns. 535 and, in particular, with the importance she attaches to the request made by an \naccused for a preliminary inquiry. There is also agreement with her with that l ocal \npractices regarding the administration of justice can legitimately vary from one \nprovince or territory to another and that this is not necessarily incompatible with the \nuniform application of substantive criminal law in Canada. However, in light of the \npractice followed in Quebec and its effect on the right of A and G to request a \npreliminary inquiry, A and G had vested rights.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n  In Quebec, accused persons typically reserve their election as to the mode \nof trial so that they can examine the evidence disclos ed.

The general understanding \namong Quebec judges and lawyers is that reserving the election as to the mode of trial \nwith the court’s authorization has the effect of preserving the right to make a request \nfor a preliminary inquiry at a later date . All of t he conditions precedent to the holding \nof a preliminary inquiry are indeed fulfilled when the election is reserved: the accused \nreceives the court’s assurance that they can make a request at a later date and, by the \nterms of s.  535, that request must be ho noured. The accused’s legal situation is \ntherefore tangible, concrete and sufficiently constituted at that time. Parliament’s \nobjective of reducing the number of preliminary inquiries should not limit vested rights \nin the absence of a transitional provisio n for existing situations.  \n Because the Court of Québec granted the requests of A and G to reserve \ntheir election as to the mode of trial before the amendments to s.  535 came into force, \nA and G had a vested right to make a request for a preliminary inquir y at a later date. \nThey were therefore governed by the former s.  535. The appeal should be dismissed . \n Per Martin  J.: There is agreement that the amendment at issue is not \npurely procedural and instead can affect an accused’s substantive legal interests. \nHowever, there is disagreement as to the point in time for the application of the new \ns. 535; the date of the offence is the preferable option.  \n In light of Parliament’s failure to legislate on the temporal application of \nthe amendment, the judicial task is  to determine when the new s.  535 applies, based on \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n the principles and presumptions concerning the temporal application of legislation, as \nwell as the values of fairness, rule of law and reasonable reliance they protect. This task \nmust be approached with t he interests of justice top of mind. The case law and the \nInterpretation Act  provide legal presumptions which guide the interpretation of \nlegislation when Parliament has failed to clearly set out its temporal application. In \nparticular, two presumptions ap ply to legislation that affects an accused’s substantive \nrights: the presumption against the retrospective application of legislation affecting \nsubstantive legal interests, and the presumption against interfering with vested rights. \nThe guiding principle o f the first presumption is that new legislation that affects \nsubstantive rights is presumed to apply prospectively, absent clear legislative intent \notherwise. New legislation that deals with procedure will also not apply immediately \nif, in its application,  it affects substantive rights. As to the second presumption, in \ncriminal cases, the Court’s jurisprudence on vested rights has previously required that \na right -holder be able to actually exercise the right and that the eventual accrual be \ncertain, and not  conditional on future events.  \n The new s.  535 of the Criminal Code should be analyzed based on the \napproach articulated and applied in R. v. Dineley , 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, \nthe Court’s most recent authority concerning the temporal application o f legislation \nwhich affects substantive interests. Dineley  makes clear that in order to engage the \npresumption against retrospectivity, it is sufficient that the legislation affects \nsubstantive rights. It stands for two key propositions: either substantive  or vested rights \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n will trigger the presumption against retrospectivity, and if the accused’s substantive \nrights are affected, the date of the offence should govern.  \n First, the presumption against retrospectivity is engaged when an \namendment may affect eit her or both substantive or vested rights. Either one, standing \nalone, is sufficient to trigger the presumption of prospective application. Once there \nhas been a finding that the substantive rights of the accused are affected, it is \nunnecessary to impose th e additional requirement that those rights must also have \nsomehow vested or accrued to the accused. There is no general requirement that all \nsubstantive rights must have also have vested before legislative amendments must be \npresumed to apply prospectively  — but even if there is, it should be characterized \nsufficiently broadly to ensure that rigid legal characterizations and formalities are not \nfavoured over fairness and an accused’s substantive interests. Any dispute over whether \nwhat must vest in the inst ant case is the right to have a preliminary inquiry or the right \nto request a preliminary inquiry should be resolved to best respect fairness to an \naccused.

Second, new criminal legislation will apply as of the date of the offence if it \naffects an accused’ s substantive legal interests.  \n The loss of the possibility of being discharged at the close of a preliminary \ninquiry is significant. It approximates the loss of a legal defence, which affects the \nsubstantive and constitutional rights of the accused. Altho ugh the accused does not \nhave a constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry, eliminating the possibility of a \ndischarge at the close of the preliminary inquiry may affect an accused’s rights to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n \n liberty and security of the person under s.  7 of the Charter . Because the new s.  535 \naffects the accused’s substantive rights and must apply prospectively only, the date of \nthe offence should govern its temporal application. It is preferable for many reasons: it \nis common to all criminal files, it is independent of  any given procedure and thus \nadaptable to potential regional differences in criminal procedure across the country, \nand it is attuned to the reality of delays or variables that may arise throughout the course \nof the criminal process at no fault of the accu sed. Determining the temporal application \nof the new s.  535 requires a solution that applies consistently across the country. The \naccused’s substantive rights should not be dependent on or shaped by regional \ndifferences in procedure, especially when it may  result in unfairness. Accordingly, \nwhere the alleged offence date is prior to September 19, 2019, an accused who would \nhave been eligible for a preliminary inquiry but for the amendment remains eligible, \nregardless of the applicable maximum punishment.  \n With respect to the interpretation of the new s.  535, there is agreement with \nKarakatsanis J. that, where the new s.  535 applies because the alleged offence date is \non or after September 19, 2019, an accused is only eligible for a preliminary inquiry if \nthey personally face a maximum punishment of 14 years or greater.  \n In the instant case, there is no basis to interfere with the decision of the \nCourt of Appeal holding that the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to the \noffence date, and the appea l should be dismissed.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n \n  Per Wagner  C.J. and  Karakatsanis , O’Bonsawin and Moreau  JJ. \n(diss enting ): Despite previous Criminal Code  amendments that have made the \npreliminary inquiry available only on request and allowed for the narrowing of its \nfocus, concern  has continued to grow over delays in criminal proceedings. In this \ncontext, Parliament opted to reform preliminary inquiries to improve the efficiency of \ncriminal proceedings and to avoid the need for witnesses to testify twice. Since the \namendment in 201 9, s. 535 limits the availability of preliminary inquiries to the most \nserious cases based on the maximum penalty for the relevant offences.  \n A predictable approach to determining temporal application must clarify \nand build on the law interpreting the rele vant presumptions developed in the Court’s \njurisprudence and codified by Parliament. As with any question of statutory \ninterpretation, determining the temporal application of a new rule must be grounded in \nthe text of the legislation read in its full conte xt and in harmony with the legislature’s \nintention. In conducting that analysis, courts must rely on all the principles of statutory \ninterpretation. Where the legislature’s intention as to the temporal application of \nspecific legislation can be discerned u sing principles of interpretation other than those \npresumptions of temporal application, courts are bound to give effect to that intention. \nHowever, absent transitional provisions and where those principles fail to provide a \nclear answer, the general presu mptions governing temporal application become central \nto the analysis.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n  The temporal application of the amendment of a Criminal Code provision \nturns on the interpretation and interrelationship between three presumptions: (1)  the \npresumption of immediate ap plication of purely procedural law, (2)  the presumption \nagainst retrospectivity, and (3)  the presumption against interference with vested",

    "text": ", the general presu mptions governing temporal application become central \nto the analysis.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \n  The temporal application of the amendment of a Criminal Code provision \nturns on the interpretation and interrelationship between three presumptions: (1)  the \npresumption of immediate ap plication of purely procedural law, (2)  the presumption \nagainst retrospectivity, and (3)  the presumption against interference with vested rights. \nThese presumptions have been in part codified by Parliament in the Interpretation Act  \n(ss. 43 and 44). First, according to the presumption of immediate application of purely \nprocedural legislation, where the change in the law is purely procedural, in that \napplying it would not, in any circumstances, affect a substantive legal interest, the new \nrule is presumed to apply immediately to all. A substantive legal interest is a right, \nprivilege, obligation or liability that it not merely about how a litigant conducts \nlitigation but has direct implications for the individual outside the courtroom. Whether \nlegislation coul d be classified as procedural in the abstract is not determinative; all that \nmatters is the presence or absence of an effect on substantive matters. Second, the \npresumption against retrospectivity means that change to the law is presumed not to \nattach new prejudicial consequences to events that occurred before the change. Third, \nthe presumption against interference with vested rights provides that legislation is \npresumed not to interfere with rights held by individuals that were tangible, concrete \nand disti nctive before it came into force. The threshold of “tangible, concrete and \ndistinctive” has two primary facets: (1)  the right must be that of the particular \nindividual rather than belonging to a community or general class; and (2)  the right must \nbe suffici ently constituted before the coming into force of the legislative change, in that \nit exists and is possessed by individuals at the relevant time. If a new rule would \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n interfere with a right with these features, such that it has “vested”, it is presumed not to \napply.  \n Applying the three presumptions at issue together in a principled way starts \nby asking whether the new rule is purely procedural since, in the affirmative, it is \nunnecessary to consider the other presumptions. Where it is shown that a new rule i s \npurely procedural, it applies immediately in all circumstances . Where, however, the \nnew rule is not purely procedural, the analysis must continue. The presumptions against \nretrospectivity and against interference with vested rights can be understood as \ndifferent sides of the same coin. Interference with a vested right is always retrospective \nin that rights arise by virtue of facts that fulfil the conditions precedent to the right and \nsubsequently impairing them changes the legal consequences of those fact s in a \nprejudicial way . The combined effect of these presumptions is to look at the facts that \nhad occurred before the new rule came into force and decide whether they establish a \nlegal interest that the law is presumed to protect.  Where the legal interest  has vested \nbefore a new rule came into force, the new rule is presumed not to apply if it would \ninterfere with that legal interest. And because the purely procedural presumption \nprovides that only substantive legal interests can raise a presumption of non -application \nthese legal interests must necessarily be substantive. Thus, in applying these three \npresumptions, the new rule will presumptively apply unless it interferes with a \nsubstantive legal interest that had vested before it came into force.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n \n  This in quiry requires understanding when a legal interest is “substantive” \nand when it has “vested”. Whether a legal interest is substantive is guided by categories \nsettled in the jurisprudence, and the underlying legal values of fairness and the rule of \nlaw rath er than the abstract procedural nature of the legislation itself. As a legal interest \nbecomes less a means to establish other rights and liabilities through litigation and more \nas an end in itself independent of that litigation, it becomes more likely that  the legal \ninterest will be substantive. A  legal interest vests once all the facts necessary to \nrecognize its existence have occurred. While those facts may generally be settled for \nrecurring categories such as criminal liability, in cases involving unique  statutory \nrights, careful attention must be paid to the nature of the right as expressed in the statute \nin light of how the legislature has balanced the reasonable expectations of interest \nholders against the democratic evolution of the law.

    "text": " legal \ninterest will be substantive. A  legal interest vests once all the facts necessary to \nrecognize its existence have occurred. While those facts may generally be settled for \nrecurring categories such as criminal liability, in cases involving unique  statutory \nrights, careful attention must be paid to the nature of the right as expressed in the statute \nin light of how the legislature has balanced the reasonable expectations of interest \nholders against the democratic evolution of the law. It will be di fficult to say a legal \ninterest is vested where it remains contingent on an intervening action or event, such \nas the favourable exercise of discretion by a third party or actions necessary to acquire \nit that are more than mere formalities.  \n There is no cle ar basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliament’s \nspecific intention regarding the temporal application of the new s.  535. It therefore falls \nto be determined using the temporal presumptions. The amendment to s.  535 was not \npurely procedural, becau se it can deprive an accused of the opportunity to be \ndischarged at a preliminary inquiry, which is a substantive legal interest. The \namendment therefore does not attract immediate application in every circumstance, and \nit is necessary to determine when th e right to a preliminary inquiry vests. It does not \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n \n vest when the offence is alleged to have been committed. The opportunity to be \ndischarged at a preliminary inquiry does not form part of the substantive law about \ncriminal liability that is understood to vest at the time of the commission of the offence. \nLiability vesting at that time protects  a person’s reliance on the state of the law when \nthey were deciding whether to risk the liability associated with breaking the law. But it \nstrains credulity to imagi ne that people weigh the availability of a preliminary inquiry \nin determining how to conduct themselves and whether to risk criminal liability. \nConduct is not made legal or illegal, nor made subject to greater or lesser penal \nconsequence because it could b e examined at a preliminary inquiry. The availability \nand exercise of the right to a preliminary inquiry also depends on significant \ncontingencies standing between the commission of the offence and the preliminary \ninquiry, including whether a charge is act ually laid and, in the case of a hybrid offence, \nwhether the Crown will elect to proceed summarily.  \n The right to a preliminary inquiry vests when the request for a preliminary \ninquiry is made, not the point in the proceedings at which there are no further  conditions \noutside of the control of the accused to ask for a preliminary inquiry. There is a \ndistinction between the ability to request a preliminary inquiry and the right to a \npreliminary inquiry itself. Section 535 frames the request as a precondition of the \nexistence of the right and ties the request to the election of mode of trial. Read together, \nthe provisions surrounding the election of the mode of trial make clear that what \ntriggers the holding of a preliminary inquiry is both the election of a mo de of trial in \nwhich a preliminary inquiry is available and the request for a preliminary inquiry to be \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n held. Even where the accused is sure to be tried by a mode through which a preliminary \ninquiry is available, the statute still mandates a request. The t ext and statutory scheme \nmake clear that Parliament intended to make the availability of a preliminary inquiry \nconditional on a request actually having been made. Accordingly, the new limitation in \ns. 535 applies to all accused persons where a request for a preliminary inquiry was not \nmade before it came into force on September 19, 2019.  The requirement that a request \nbe made ensures there is a clear rule that can be given a uniform interpretation across \nCanada.  \n Whether a request for a preliminary inquiry has been made is a factual \nquestion dependent on the circumstances of each individual case. The reserve or \npostponement of an election of mode of trial does not amount to an actual request for \na preliminary inquiry. Assimilating a reserve to a request woul d effectively mean that \nthe mere possibility of making a request is enough, despite the clear intent of Parliament \nto make the request an essential prerequisite. In the instant case neither A nor G had \nmade a request for a preliminary inquiry before Septem ber 19, 2019.  Their proceedings \nwere accordingly governed by the new limitation on the availability of preliminary \ninquiries.  \n  The question of whether an accused in the circumstances of A and G and \nsubject to the new rule in s.  535 would be eligible for a  preliminary inquiry in \naccordance with its terms turns on whether they qualify as an “accused who is",

    "text": " neither A nor G had \nmade a request for a preliminary inquiry before Septem ber 19, 2019.  Their proceedings \nwere accordingly governed by the new limitation on the availability of preliminary \ninquiries.  \n  The question of whether an accused in the circumstances of A and G and \nsubject to the new rule in s.  535 would be eligible for a  preliminary inquiry in \naccordance with its terms turns on whether they qualify as an “accused who is charged \nwith an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment”. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n The text in s.  535, read in context and in light of the purpos es of the provision, requires \nthat the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years’ imprisonment in respect of the \noffence for a preliminary inquiry to be available. Parliament intended for only those \naccused facing greater maximum jeopardy to retain th e benefit of a preliminary inquiry. \nThe focus of the text is on the accused and the accused’s proceedings, and not on \nhypotheticals or the general nature of the offence.  This focus on the specific \nproceedings of the accused also follows the broader context  of the new provision, \nwhich makes clear that preliminary inquiries are now generally unavailable, and that \ntheir availability is restricted only to those accused who meet specific and clear \nconditions.  \n Furthermore, the overall purpose of limiting the ava ilability of the \npreliminary inquiry was to reduce delays, to alleviate the burden of witnesses and \nvictims, and to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system. These broader \npurposes inform the specific objectives of s.  535, which represents an exception for \nserious offences. While Parliament was seeking to reduce systemic obstacles to the \nCharter  right to a trial without unreasonable delay, the exception recognizes that a \npreliminary inquiry can still be of significant benefit to an accused faci ng more \nsignificant legal jeopardy. Given these purposes, it is difficult to accept that Parliament \nadopted a threshold meant to invite a hypothetical inquiry into what the maximum \nsentence for the accused would have been had it occurred at another time. S entencing \nprinciples and current societal values are of little assistance in interpreting s.  535. The \nproxy for seriousness selected by Parliament is the maximum  sentence carried by the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n offence charged, not the fit sentence. In the instant case, neither A nor G are eligible \nfor a preliminary inquiry under the new s.  535, as the offences with which they are \ncharged are each punishable by a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. Accordingly, \nthe appeal should be allowed.  \nCases Cited  \nBy Côté and Rowe JJ.  \n Applied: Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General ), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] \n3 S.C.R. 530; distinguished: Tran v.

Conclusion  81 \nI. Overview  \n[1] This appeal raises the question of the temporal application of a legislative \namendment through which the right of accused persons to a preliminary inquiry, \nenshrined in s.  535 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.  C-46 (“Cr. C.”), is limited to \nthe most se rious cases, as well as the question of how the amended provision should be \ninterpreted going forward. The appeal has become moot as regards the respondents, \nAgénor Archambault and Gilles Grenier, for whom preliminary inquiries were held in \nparallel with t he appeal that has made its way to this Court. We are nevertheless of the \nview that it is in the public interest to address the above questions on the merits in order \nto clear up some continuing uncertainty over the state of the law ( Borowski v.

    "text": " ( Borowski v. Canada \n(Attorney General) , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at pp.  361-62; R. v. Smith , 2004 SCC 14, \n[2004] 1 S.C.R. 385, at paras.  49-50; R. v. McNeil , 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at \npara.  2; R. v. Oland , 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para.  17). \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n \n [2] We agree with our co lleague Karakatsanis  J. that the amendment made to \ns. 535 Cr. C. is procedural in nature but affects a substantive right, that is, an accused’s \nright under s.  548(1)(b) Cr. C. to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the \nevidence adduced during t he preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put \nthe accused on trial on the charge. With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in holding \nthat the right to a preliminary inquiry is governed by the law in force at the time the \noffence was committ ed. \n[3] However, unlike our colleague Karakatsanis  J., we are of the view that the \nrespondents, Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault, had a vested right to a preliminary \ninquiry. The right to a preliminary inquiry crystallizes at the time charges are laid.  \n[4] In the absence of a transitional provision, such an interpretation is the one \nmost consistent with both the text of s.  535 Cr. C. and the presumption that Parliament \ndoes not intend to interfere with the vested rights or privileges of accused persons. This  \ninterpretation is also anchored in the notion that criminal trials do not all proceed in the \nsame purely linear fashion and that they each have their own particular features. Indeed, \nwhen it comes to the order of the various stages of the proceedings, the re are a multitude \nof possibilities. Finding that the right vests when charges are laid, a stage common to \nall cases, better acknowledges the flexibility of criminal procedure and the delays that \nmay be caused by the Crown or the delays inherent in the jus tice system. Such an \ninterpretation has the advantage of preserving fairness and legal certainty in addition \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n \n to allowing for the uniform application of the new legislative provision across the \ncountry.  \n[5] Regardless of whether a right vested in Mr.  Grenier an d Mr.  Archambault \nbefore the legislative amendment came into force, we are of the opinion that the \nrespondents have such a right under the current version of s.  535 Cr. C. Parliament \nintended to preserve the preliminary inquiry for all accused persons whos e alleged \noffence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, and not, \nas the Crown argues, only for accused persons who are personally liable to 14 years or \nmore of imprisonment. This is the interpretation most consistent with t he text of the \namending provision and the compromise from which it resulted. The Crown’s proposed \ninterpretation of this provision, based on an abstract purpose — reducing the number \nof preliminary inquiries held across the country — is not supported eithe r by the clear \ntext of the new s.  535 Cr. C. or by the circumstances in which it was enacted.  \n[6] We would therefore dismiss the appeal.  \nII. Factual Background and Judicial History  \n[7] On the whole, we agree with the summary of the facts and judicial history \nprovided by our colleague Karakatsanis  J. However, we will make some additional \npoints that help to circumscribe the issues.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n \n [8] The Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry accrues at \ntwo different points in time. First, relying on the principle of  legality, the Court of \nAppeal found that the right to a preliminary inquiry is “‘accruing’ from th[e] moment” \nthe offence is committed (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174, at para.  11). In \nHealy  J.A.’s view, the classification of offences (indictable, hybr id or summary \nconviction",

First, relying on the principle of  legality, the Court of \nAppeal found that the right to a preliminary inquiry is “‘accruing’ from th[e] moment” \nthe offence is committed (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174, at para.  11). In \nHealy  J.A.’s view, the classification of offences (indictable, hybr id or summary \nconviction) and everything that flows from it (election as to mode of trial and \npreliminary inquiry) are part of the law on which individuals rely in adjusting their \nbehaviour and in assuming risks at the time of committing an offence (paras.  16-17). \n[9] Second, the Court of Appeal found that the right to a preliminary inquiry \nis “vested or accrued at the date” of the first appearance (para.  11). Even when the \naccused does not request a preliminary inquiry, the first appearance confirms the \nvestin g of the right. This interpretation is based on the importance of the legislative \namendment to the rights or interests concerned, not on the characterization of the \namendment as procedural or substantive in nature. As long as the accused has not \nelected tr ial before a provincial court judge, the accused’s right to request a preliminary \ninquiry is preserved.  \n[10] Given its conclusion on this point, the Court of Appeal did not address the \nquestion of how the amended version of s.  535 Cr. C. should be interpreted.  \nIII. Legislative Background on the Preliminary Inquiry  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n \n [11] An inheritance from English law, the preliminary inquiry was incorporated \ninto Canadian criminal law in 1892, in the first Criminal Code, 1892 , S.C. 1892, c.  29 \n(s. 577; see also D.  Pomerant and G.  Gilmour,  A Survey of the Preliminary Inquiry in \nCanada  (April 1993), at pp.  1-24). The preliminary inquiry was originally designed as \nan instrument of the prosecution, for finding the perpetrator of a crime and obtaining \nevidence of their guilt; it later became “a  shield for the defence”, allowing the accused \nto ascertain what evidence the prosecution had against them and also “relieving [them] \nfrom the expense and odium of a trial” if, in the opinion of the justice of the peace or \nprovincial court judge, that evid ence was not sufficient to justify holding a trial \n(Skogman  v. The Queen , [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93, at p.  105, quoting P.  Devlin, The Criminal \nProsecution in England  (1960), at p.  10). \n[12] The preliminary inquiry therefore has two important aspects. Its primary \npurpose is “to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to \npublic trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant \nthe continuation of the process” ( Skogman , at p.  105). It is a “screening mechanism for \nthe purpose of determining whether the Crown has sufficient evidence to commit the \naccused to trial” ( R. v. S.J.L. , 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 426, at para.  21, citing R. \nv. Hynes , 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para.  30 and R. v. Sazant , 2004 SCC \n77, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 635, at paras.  14-16). The preliminary inquiry also plays an \n“ancillary role as a discovery mechanism” ( Hynes , at para.  31). In English law, the \nCrown’s duty to disclose evidence at the preliminary inquiry has evolved in such a way \nas to make it a very effective discovery mechanism, which has not historically been the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n \n case in Canada ( Law Reform Commission of Canada, Research Paper: Discovery in \nCriminal Cases  (1974), at pp.  8-9). \n[13] While the preliminary inquiry allows an accused to learn m ore about the \nprosecution’s evidence, the disclosure of evidence is primarily assured, in Canadian \nlaw, by the accused’s constitutional right to make full answer and defence, a principle \nof fundamental justice enshrined in s.

Stinchcombe , [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326; R. v. Egger , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451; \nR. v. O’Connor , [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411; R. v. La , [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680; R. v. Dixon , [1998] \n1 S.C.R. 244, at para.  22; R. v. Taillefer , 2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3 07; McNeil , \nat paras.  17-25; R. v. Gubbins , 2018 SCC 44, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 35). This constitutional \nright to the disclosure of all relevant information is distinct from the right to a \npreliminary inquiry, which is what led this Court to state in S.J.L. , at p ara. 23, that “the \nincidental function of the preliminary inquiry as a discovery mechanism has lost much \nof its relevance” since the enactment of the Charter . Parliament’s choice to limit or \nabolish the preliminary inquiry for certain offences therefore do es not violate the \nprinciples of fundamental justice, because the accused continues to be presumed \ninnocent and retains the right to make full answer and defence (para.  21). There is no \nconstitutional right to a preliminary inquiry.  \n[14] At the beginning of thi s century, Parliament considered ways to reduce the \nnumber, length and scope of preliminary inquiries in response to an increase in court \ndelays and in light of the impact of this procedure on victims and other witnesses. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n However, a radical reform was rule d out (see R. v. M. (P.) , 2007 QCCA 414, 222 C.C.C. \n(3d) 393, at paras.  68-73). The solution favoured by Parliament, a more moderate one, \nwas set out in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001 , S.C. 2002, c.  13. One purpose \nof that statute was “reforming and modernizing criminal procedure with respect to .  . . \nprocedural aspects of preliminary inquiries” (summary, subpara.  (f)(i)). Its provisions, \nwhich came into force on June 1, 2004, amended the Cr. C. in order to, among other \nthings, make the holding of a p reliminary inquiry optional, allow parties to limit the \nscope of an inquiry or allow a pre -hearing conference to be held, give the justice the \npower to regulate the course of the inquiry and authorize the justice to end any abusive \nexaminations or cross -examinations. Those amendments maintained the accused’s \n“unconditional right” to a preliminary inquiry while streamlining the use of this \nprocedure and making it optional ( House of Commons Debates , vol.  136, No.  124, 2nd \nSess., 36th Parl., September 28, 2000 , at p.  8829; Debates of the Senate , vol.  139, \nNo. 66, 1st Sess., 37th Parl., November 1, 2001, at p.  1612).  \n[15] Parliament’s intent in making those legislative amendments was to enable \nparties to choose mechanisms better adapted to their needs; its intent was  “not the \nimposition [on them] of more inflexible procedures” ( S.J.L. , at para.  24). To allow \nparties to decide whether a preliminary inquiry was appropriate in their circumstances, \nParliament changed the wording of s.  535 Cr. C. as follows:  \n 535. If an ac cused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a \njustice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under \nsubsection 536(4) or 536",

In its report, the Committee \nrecom mended eliminating preliminary inquiries or limiting them “to the most serious \noffences under the Criminal Code ” in order to reduce delays in criminal cases \n(Delaying Justice Is Denying Justice:  An Urgent Need to Address Lengthy Court \nDelays in Canada (Fin al Report)  (2017), at p.  48). \n[17] One year earlier, in R. v. Jordan , 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, \nMoldaver, Karakatsanis and Brown  JJ., writing for the majority, had invited Parliament \nto undertake a review of criminal rules and procedures, particularly t he preliminary \ninquiry (at para.  140):  \n For provincial legislatures and Parliament, this may mean taking a fresh \nlook at rules, procedures, and other areas of the criminal law to ensure that \nthey are more conducive to timely justice and that the criminal p rocess \nfocusses on what is truly necessary to a fair trial. Legal Aid has a role to \nplay in securing the participation of experienced defence counsel, \nparticularly for long, complex trials. And Parliament may wish to consider \nthe value of preliminary inqui ries in light of expanded disclosure \nobligations.  Government will also need to consider whether the criminal \njustice system (and any initiatives aimed at reducing delay) is adequately \nresourced. [Emphasis added.]  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n [18] In response to the invitation extended by t his Court in Jordan  and the \nobservations made by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional \nAffairs in its report, the government introduced a first version of Bill  C-75 in \nParliament on March 29, 2018. The original version of the bill limit ed the availability \nof preliminary inquiries to adults charged with offences punishable by life \nimprisonment (Bill  C-75, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal \nJustice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts , 1st \nSess., 42nd Parl., 2018, s.  240 (first reading March 29, 2018); House of Commons \nDebates , vol. 148, No.  300, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 24, 2018, at p.  19604 (Hon. \nJ. Wilson -Raybould)).  \n[19] Given the concerns expressed by the legal community about that appro ach, \nand further to an amendment proposal made by the Senate, the wording of the bill was \nchanged to expand access to preliminary inquiries by comparison with what had been \nset out in the original bill. A choice was made to preserve the right of accused pe rsons \nto a preliminary inquiry for all of what were considered to be the most serious offences. \nIn this context, Parliament decided to preserve access in the case of offences for which \nthe maximum sentence was 14 years or more. We use the term “most seriou s offences” \nbelow to refer to such offences:  \n As introduced, Bill C -75 proposed to restrict the availability of preliminary \ninquiries to indictable offences punishable by life imprisonment, roughly \n70 offences.

The other place agreed that these offences sh ould \nautomatically include a preliminary inquiry.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n \n  However, it also expanded their availability on a discretionary basis to \nall other indictable offences with a maximum penalty of less than life \nimprisonment, which would have been an additional 393 offences. As per \nthe other place’s amendment, preliminary inquiries would be available in \ntwo circumstances: first, where one or both parties requested one; and, \nsecond, a justice was satisfied that certain criteria were met, namely that \nappropriate measur es were taken to mitigate the impacts on victims for \nboth approaches and, where it was on the request of one party, that it was \nalso in the best interest of the administration of justice.  \n The amendment responded to concerns that preliminary inquiries were  \nnot available for more and serious offences. However, the expansion of \ntheir availability, combined with the new complex criteria, would lead, in \nour view, to further delays and unnecessary litigation; for example, to \ninterpret the proper application of t he criteria.  \n Recognizing, however, that the other place’s amendment was motivated \nby continuing concerns by the legal community and others, I proposed to \nnot accept the other place’s amendments 3 and 4 as drafted, but to revise \nthe bill’s original approac h to make preliminary inquiries also available for \noffences with a maximum penalty of 14 years, for example, sexual assault \nwith a weapon.  \n (House of Commons Debates , vol. 148, No.  435, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June \n17, 2019, at p.  29245  (Hon. D.  Lametti))  \n[20] That version of the bill was assented to on June 21, 2019, and stipulated \nthat the new preliminary inquiry provisions would come into force 90 days later, on \nSeptember 19, 2019 (see An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal \nJustice Act and other  Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts , S.C. \n2019, c.  25 (“2019 Amendments”), s.  406). The wording of s.  535 Cr.

J.  Wilson -Raybould); see also House of Commons Debates , June \n17, 2019, at pp.  29245 -46 (Hon.  D. Lametti)). To this end, Parliament has limited the \nright of accused  persons to request a preliminary inquiry to the offences that are \nconsidered to be the most serious. In the context of this amendment, the category of the \nmost serious offences is understood by Parliament as consisting of indictable offences \npunishable by  a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or more.  \nIV.

Both in matters of transitional law and in \nstatutory interpretation generally , [TRANSLATION ] “the legislative intent is paramount” \n(P.-A. Côté and M.  Devinat, Interprétation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at No.  457; see also \nR. v. Ali , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 221, at p.  235). Our role is therefore limited to discerning the \ntrue legislative inte nt by reading the words of the provision in their entire context and \nin their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme and object of \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n \n the legislation ( Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para.  21, quoting \nE. A. Driedger,  Construction of Statutes (2nd ed.  1983), at p.  87; Bell ExpressVu \nLimited Partnership v. Rex , 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para.  26). \n[23] Our analysis proceeds as follows. First, we discuss how the new s.  535 \nCr. C. applies temporally. Second, we inte rpret the scope of s.  535 Cr. C. as amended. \nOn the basis of our analysis, we conclude that the respondents, Mr.  Grenier and \nMr. Archambault, each have the right to a preliminary inquiry both under the former \nlaw, whose effects with respect to them survive  the legislative amendment, and under \nthe new law.  \nA. The Legislative Amendment Does Not Eliminate the Right to a Preliminary \nInquiry for Accused Persons Charged Before It Came Into Force  \n(1) Principles of Transitional Law Applicable in This Case  \n[24] The starting poi nt in analyzing the temporal application of new legislation \nis always the legislation itself. In the absence of a transitional provision, and where the \nlawmaker’s intention to give the legislation a particular effect does not appear expressly \nor by necessa ry implication upon reading the legislation, as is the case here, recourse \nmust be had specifically to the rules laid down in interpretation statutes and court \ndecisions.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n \n [25] The Crown argues that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the right \nto a prelim inary inquiry is governed by the law in force at the time the offence with \nwhich the accused is charged was committed. The effect that the new s.  535 Cr. C. must \nbe given thus depends rather on the application of the presumption against interference \nwith vested rights. According to the Crown, if there is a vested right to a preliminary \ninquiry, this right does not vest until a valid request for such an inquir y is made.  \n[26] In this case, assessing the merits of these arguments brings into play three \nwell-established principles of transitional law, which one must be careful not to \nconflate: (1)  the principle of legality; (2)  the presumption against interference with  \nvested rights; and (3)  the exception based on the immediate application of purely \nprocedural provisions. On the basis of the first principle, the Court of Appeal held that \nthe right to a preliminary inquiry is accruing from the moment the offence is commi tted. \nOn the basis of the second principle, it held that this right is vested at the date of the \nfirst appearance. None of the parties argues that the third principle applies here, but this \nprinciple must still be considered in order to resolve the questio n of the temporal \napplication of the new s.  535 Cr. C. \n[27] The principle of legality is a “pillar of the criminal law” whose purpose is \nto preserve the law as it stood at the time an offence was committed ( R. v. Poulin , 2019 \nSCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at par a. 59). The principle was helpfully summarized by \nIacobucci and Arbour  JJ. in R. v. Johnson , 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357 : “As a \ngeneral matter, persons accused of criminal conduct are to be charged and sentenced \n2024 SCC 35 (",

Johnson , 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357 : “As a \ngeneral matter, persons accused of criminal conduct are to be charged and sentenced \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n \n under the criminal law provisions in pl ace at the time that the offence allegedly was \ncommitted” (para.  41). This rule finds expression in two forms, both of which are \nembodied in the Charter (Côté and Devinat, at Nos.  566-67; G.  Côté -Harper, \nP. Rainville and J.  Turgeon, Traité de droit pénal c anadien  (4th ed. rev. 1998), at \npp. 99-120). First, the new legislation cannot make criminal any act or omission that \ndid not constitute an offence at the time it occurred; s.  11(g) guarantees to any person \ncharged with an offence the right not to be found  guilty under such legislation. Second, \nthe new legislation cannot create more severe punishments for an offence committed \nbefore it came into force; s.  11(i) guarantees to any person charged with an offence the \nright to the benefit of the lesser punishmen t if the punishment has been varied between \nthe time of commission of the offence and the time of sentencing. The rule of law and \nthe fairness of criminal proceedings depend on this ( R. v. Kelly , [1992] 2 S.C.R. 170, \nat p. 203, per McLachlin  J.; Poulin , at para.  59; R. v. K.R.J. , 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 \nS.C.R. 906, at paras.  22-25). \n[28] The presumption that Parliament does not intend to interfere with vested \nrights or privileges is one of the fundamental principles of transitional law. To ensure \nthe certainty of the legal consequences attaching to facts and conduct predating a \nlegislative amendment, “a statute should not be given a construction that would impair \nexisting rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched \nrequires such a construction” ( Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National \nRevenue , [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271 , at pp.  282-83, citing Spooner Oils Ltd. v. Turner Valley \nGas Conservation , [1933] S.C.R. 629, at p.  638; see also Dikranian v. Quebec \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n (Attorney General ), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at para.  33). Legislation that \naffects substantive rights can only apply prospectively to cases in which these rights \nhave not yet vested ( R. v. Chouhan , 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at para.  87). \n[29] There is just one ex ception to this presumption, namely that “there is no \nvested right in procedure”, though this is subject to “a limitation to the effect that the \nfollowing of the new procedure must be feasible” ( Wildman v.

However, this exception is merely a presumption and must therefore yield to a \ncontrary intention expressed by the lawmaker ( Ali, at p.  235).  \n[30] The following provisions of the Interpretation Act , R.S.C. 1985, c.  I-21, \ncodify the presumption against interference with vested rights and the exception based \non the immediate application of purely procedural provisions:  \n 43 Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not  \n . . . \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n \n  (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, \naccruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed,  \n . . . \n 44 Where an enactment, in this section called the “former enactment”, is \nrepealed and another enactment, in this section called the “new enactment”, \nis substituted therefor,  \n . . . \n (c) every proceeding taken under the former enactment shall be taken \nup and continued under and in conformity with the new enactment in so \nfar as it may be done consistently with the new enactmen t; \n (d) the procedure established by the new enactment shall be followed as \nfar as it can be adapted thereto  \n . . . \n (ii) in the enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former \nenactment,  \n[31] With respect, it is not helpful to address the principl e of legality from the \nperspective of vested rights, as the Court of Appeal did in this case, nor is it appropriate \nto erase the distinction between non -retroactivity and non -interference with vested \nrights (see  Venne v. Quebec (Commission de protection du  territoire agricole) , [1989] \n1 S.C.R. 880 , at p.  906; Attorney General of Quebec v. Expropriation Tribunal , [1986] \n1 S.C.R. 732, at pp.  741 and 744; Gustavson Drilling , at pp.  279 and 282; Dikranian , \nat para.  31). Such an approach injects more uncertainty  and confusion into transitional \nlaw than it resolves. We are dealing not with a provision that might change the legal \nrules applicable at the time the offence was committed, which would engage the \nprinciple of legality, but rather with a legislative amend ment whose purpose is to limit \nthe use of a criminal procedure for the future.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n [32] We therefore propose simply to follow the structure of ss.  43 and 44 of the \nInterpretation Act . The first question to be considered in determining how new \nlegislation applies te mporally is whether the legislative amendment is purely \nprocedural in nature. If the amendment in issue may affect a right or privilege that \nvested under the prior enactment, the time at which that right or privilege vested must \nbe determined. It will be p resumed to be preserved only for persons in whom it actually \nvested before the legislative amendment came into force.  \n(2) The Abolition of the Preliminary Inquiry for Certain Offences Is \nProcedural in Nature but Affects a Substantive Right  \n[33] The absence of any indication from Parliament as to the temporal \napplication of a provision triggers the presumption that the legislative amendment does \nnot affect vested rights or privileges. In this case, the amending statute contains several \ntransitional provisions, but n one of them concerns the sections relating to the \npreliminary inquiry regime. There is nothing in the new enactment that makes it \npossible to clearly discern Parliament’s intent with respect to its temporal application. \nIn such circumstances, it must be co ncluded that Parliament intended to rely on the \npresumptions, not to displace them.  \n[34] Mr. Grenier and Mr.  Archambault are asking this Court to affirm, as the \nCourt of Appeal did, that the right to a preliminary inquiry is governed by the \nsubstantive law in f orce at the time the offence was committed",

Reaching this \nconclusion would end the analysis.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n \n [35] However, with respect for the contrary view, we are of the opinion that the \nabolition of the preliminary inquiry for certain offences does not engage the principle  \nof legality. This measure has no impact on the scope of criminal liability. The \npreliminary inquiry is not a legal rule on which an accused may rely in adjusting his \nbehaviour or in deciding to accept the consequences of breaking it at the moment he \ncommi ts an offence ( Poulin , at para.  59). It “is not a trial but simply a preliminary \nreview to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial” ( Hynes , at \npara.  4; see also A.  Stylios, J.  Casgrain and M. -É. O’Brien, Procédure pénale (2023), \nat para.  10-3). \n[36] It must therefore be asked whether the abolition of the preliminary inquiry \nin the case of accused persons charged with an indictable offence punishable by less \nthan 14 years of imprisonment affects a substantive right or whether, the amend ment \nbeing purely procedural in nature, the new enactment must apply immediately to all \nproceedings, whether commenced before or after it came into force. Provincial court \nand superior court judges across the country have expressed conflicting opinions on the \nmatter. Importantly, the Crown does not argue that the legislative amendment is purely \nprocedural in nature, but rather questions when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests.  \n[37] On this point, we agree for the most part with the analysis of our colleagu e \nKarakatsanis  J. It is true that Parliament’s choice to limit or abolish the right to a \npreliminary inquiry in the case of certain offences does not affect the accused’s right \nto make full answer and defence, because there is no constitutional right to a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n preliminary inquiry ( S.J.L. , at para.  21). That being said, as Doherty  J.A. established in \nR. v. R.S. , 2019 ONCA 906, the limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry affects \nthe accused’s right under s.  548(1)(b) Cr. C. to be discharged of any charge if, on the \nwhole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is \nmade out to put the accused on trial on the charge (para.  49; see also R. v. Arcuri , 2001 \nSCC 54 , [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828 ). The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is  in fact to \n“protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial \nwhere the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the \ncontinuation of the process” ( Hynes , at para.  30, quoting Skogman , at p.  105). It may \nalso happen that, following a preliminary inquiry, an accused will be committed for \ntrial on offences distinct from the one initially charged, a situation that may lead to a \nreview of the decision then in effect on the accused’s interi m release, pursuant to \ns. 523(2)(b) Cr. C. \n[38] This is not a case in which the legislative amendment would affect only the \nmanner of proceeding or of conducting litigation. Any limitation on the right to a \npreliminary inquiry therefore has a direct impact on t he liberty and security of accused \npersons ( R.S., at paras.  52 and 57 -58). The legislative amendment, whose purpose is to \nlimit the preliminary inquiry to the most serious offences, cannot be considered a purely \nprocedural amendment.  \n[39] We also agree with our  colleague Karakatsanis  J. that simply concluding \nthat procedural legislation may affect vested or substantive rights is not sufficient to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n determine the temporal application of a legislative amendment where the vest",

The legislative amendment, whose purpose is to \nlimit the preliminary inquiry to the most serious offences, cannot be considered a purely \nprocedural amendment.  \n[39] We also agree with our  colleague Karakatsanis  J. that simply concluding \nthat procedural legislation may affect vested or substantive rights is not sufficient to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n \n determine the temporal application of a legislative amendment where the vesting of \nthese rights may be questioned. In  Dineley , this Court cautioned against categorizing \nthe nature of a legislative amendment in an overly rigid manner without considering its \neffects on “vested or substantive rights” (para.  10). The use of the word “or” in the \nexpression “vested or substant ive rights” cannot be interpreted as creating two distinct \nclasses of rights, one that protects rights from any retrospective effect and the other \nproviding protection only if the rights in question have vested. This would amount to \nnullifying the presumpt ion against interference with vested rights. Therefore, with due \nrespect for the approach adopted by our colleague Martin  J., the fact that new \nprocedural legislation may, through its effects, interfere with a substantive right does \nnot end the analysis. T he right or privilege in question must also have been vested at \nthe time that legislation came into force.  \n[40] We would add that the fact that a legislative amendment affects “interests” \nof a constitutional nature is not in itself determinative of how the legi slative amendment \napplies temporally (Martin  J.’s reasons, at para.  110). That would be a considerable \nextension of the constitutional sphere, which would have the effect of unjustifiably \nbroadening the scope of the presumption against interference with ve sted rights, \nespecially given that the constitutionality of the amendment in issue is not being \nchallenged. In Dineley , it was unnecessary for this Court to consider when the right had \nvested, because the legislative amendment had come into force during th e trial. Holding \nthat the presumption on vested rights applied and that it was impossible for proceedings \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n \n commenced under the former enactment to be continued in conformity with the new \nenactment, as contemplated by Ali, was sufficient to dispose of the ap peal.  \n[41] There is more. In a criminal context, the conclusion that new procedural \nlegislation affects vested or substantive rights does not necessarily engage the principle \nof legality. Vested or substantive rights within the meaning of Dineley  must not be \nconfused with the substantive law in force at the time the offence was committed within \nthe meaning of Poulin . A right may be vested or substantive without having any impact \non the scope of criminal liability, that is, the nature or consequences of the commi ssion \nof an offence. The reverse is also true. It is possible for an accused not to have a vested \nright to the rules in force at the time the offence was committed. With respect, the \napproach adopted by the Court of Appeal in this case creates such confusi on. \n[42] In light of our conclusion on this question, and in the absence of any \nindication that justifies concluding otherwise, the presumption that Parliament did not \nintend to interfere with vested rights or privileges in relation to preliminary inquiries \napplies. What must now be determined is when this right vests in order to decide \nwhether Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault were entitled to the preliminary inquiries \nthey obtained following an agreement with the Crown.  \n(3) The Right to a Preliminary Inquiry Vests a t the Time Charges Are Laid  \n[43] The core issue in this appeal is when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests \nfor the purposes of s.  43(c) of the Interpretation Act . If an amendment may affect a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n \n right existing under the former law, the right in question will be presumed to be \npreserved only for accused persons in whom it actually vested before the amendment \ncame into force.  \n[44] The determination of what constitutes a vested right or privilege is a \ndelicate matter. In Dikranian , this Court set out two conditions to  be met by an \nindividual claiming a vested right or privilege. First, the individual’s legal situation \nmust be “tangible and concrete rather than general and abstract” (para.  37). The mere \npossibility of availing oneself of a statute is not a basis for arg uing that a vested right \nexists; “the right must be vested in",

The mere \npossibility of availing oneself of a statute is not a basis for arg uing that a vested right \nexists; “the right must be vested in a specific individual” (para.  39). Second, the \nindividual’s legal situation must be sufficiently tangible and constituted at the time the \nnew legislation comes into force; in other words, the si tuation must have materialized \nto some degree (paras.  37 and 40).  \n[45] For the legal situation to be sufficiently constituted, the conditions \nprecedent to the exercise of a right must have been fulfilled. Only then can the right be \nvested ( R. v. Puskas , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, at para.  14). However, the right can still \nvest in time even if not all procedural steps required to exercise the right were taken \nbefore a legislative amendment came into force (see, e.g., Re Falconbridge Nickel \nMines Ltd. and Minister of R evenue for Ontario  (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.), at \npp. 248-50; see also Côté and Devinat, at No.  638; R.  Sullivan, The Construction of \nStatutes  (7th ed. 2022), at pp.  729-30). The difficulty therefore lies in distinguishing, \non the one hand, what are s imply the necessary procedural steps for exercising the right \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n from, on the other, the conditions precedent to the exercise of the right. Only the latter \nmust be fulfilled for the right to vest.  \n[46] Mr. Grenier and Mr.  Archambault, echoing in part the Court of Appeal’s \nconclusions in this regard, argue principally that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests \nat the time the offence is committed and, in the alternative, that the right vests at the \ntime of the first appearance. It is relevant to note that the Ont ario Court of Appeal, \nunlike its Quebec counterpart, has found that the right to a preliminary inquiry does not \nvest until the date the accused requests such an inquiry (see R.S., at para.  4). In the \npresent case, the Crown is asking this Court to adopt th is latter approach and to reject \nthe one favoured by the Court of Appeal of Quebec.  \n[47] The Crown correctly submits that a right or a privilege cannot vest at \nseveral different points in time. It is true that there is a notable difference in formulation \nbetwee n the French and English versions of s.  43(c) of the Interpretation Act . The \nFrench version refers first to “ droits ou avantages acquis ”, and then to “ obligations \ncontractées ” and “ responsabilités encourues ”. The English version does not use \nspecific langu age for rights and privileges, referring rather to “any right, privilege, \nobligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred.” In principle, the words \n“acquired, accrued, accruing” should have different meanings, because Parliament does \nnot sp eak in vain ( Attorney General of Quebec v. Carrières Ste -Thérèse Ltée , [1985] 1 \nS.C.R. 831, at p.  838; Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI -Macdonald Corp. , 2007 SCC \n30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at para.  87; R. v. Morrison , 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n \n at para.  89). However, as Professor Ruth Sullivan noted, “the prolix style in which the \nprovision is drafted (typical of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) blunts the \nforce of this presumption” (p.  768). This Court therefore stated in Puskas  that the wo rds \n“acquired”, “accrued” and “accruing” used in s.  43(c) of the Interpretation Act  \nessentially refer to the same idea: “.  . . something can only be said to be ‘accru",

The time of the offence cannot be the point at which th e right to a \npreliminary inquiry vests, since the accused’s legal situation is not sufficiently tangible, \nconcrete and distinctive at that time. It is not until the accused is charged that their legal \nsituation becomes tangible, concrete and distinctive. A t the time charges are laid, the \ncriminal court process begins and the accused actually faces criminal jeopardy.  \n[49] We are also of the view that, under the second step of the test laid down in \nDikranian , the accused’s situation is sufficiently constituted at the time charges are \nlaid. At that point, the vesting of the right is certain and not conditional on future events, \nbecause the accused will inevitably have to appear and choose to exercise or waive \ntheir right to a preliminary inquiry, or to reserve their  election. All of the conditions \nprecedent to the vesting of the right are also fulfilled at that time. In our opinion, the \nrequest that the accused must make to a justice is a necessary procedural step for \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n \n exercising the right to a preliminary inquiry, bu t it has no effect on its crystallization. \nThis can be confirmed simply by looking at the wording of s.  535 Cr. C., bearing in \nmind the purpose of the legislative amendments that came into force in 2004 and 2019.  \n[50] Section 535 Cr. C. opens with the phrase “[ i]f an accused who is charged  \nwith an indictable offence”, which sets the charging of the accused as the condition for \nentitlement to a preliminary inquiry. The Court of Appeal correctly noted that “[t]hese \nwords point unmistakably to the moment of chargin g as the moment at which the \nentitlement to a preliminary inquiry .  . . is fully vested in the accused” (para.  37). It is \ntrue that s.  535 Cr. C. states that an accused must be “charged with an indictable \noffence ” (“inculpé d’un acte criminel ”). In the cas e of a hybrid offence, the Crown may \nnot yet have decided on the mode of prosecution at the time charges are laid. However, \nthis is not a consideration that makes the right less certain or concrete. There is a \nfundamental distinction between a right that h as vested but can be challenged and a \nright that has not vested because the conditions precedent to its crystallization have not \nbeen fulfilled. Therefore, neither the fact that the Crown may elect to proceed \nsummarily or by direct indictment under s.  577 Cr. C. nor the possibility that the \naccused will elect to be tried in provincial court prevents the right to a preliminary \ninquiry from being acquired by the accused ( R.S., at para.  40). \n[51] The accused must make a request before a justice in order for a preli minary \ninquiry to be held, but the vesting of the accused’s right is not conditional on the making \nof such a request. Section 535 Cr. C. is under the heading “Jurisdiction” and concerns \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n \n the justice’s duty to conduct a preliminary inquiry. This duty is separate from the \naccused’s right to a preliminary inquiry. From a procedural standpoint, a preliminary \ninquiry is held only if a request to  this effect is made by one of the parties (ss.  535, \n536(2) and (4) and 536.1(2) and (3) Cr. C.); this is why the justice’s duty  to conduct an \ninquiry arises only if one is requested.

In this context, the request for a preliminary \ninquiry triggers the just ice’s duty but is not a condition precedent to the existence of \nthe right to a preliminary inquiry itself.  \n[52] In this regard, we cannot agree with our colleague Karakatsanis J.’s reading \nof Puskas . That case dealt with amendments to s.  691(2) Cr. C. that abol ished appeals \nas of right to this Court for accused persons whose acquittal had been overturned by a \ncourt of appeal, where a new trial had been ordered. The right to appeal to this Court \nwithout leave was accompanied by a procedural requirement, namely th e filing of a \nnotice of appeal within the statutory time limits (see Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, \nc. S-26, ss.  58 to 60). In Puskas , this Court did not include the filing of the notice of \nappeal in the set of conditions to be met for the vesting of the right in question \n(para.  15). In the same way, the making of a request for a preliminary inquiry is not a \ncondition precedent  to the existence of the right to a preliminary inquiry, but rather \nconstitutes the exercise of the right itself . \n[53] To conclude other wise would be to give the 2004 legislative amendments \na scope they were not intended to have. As this Court noted in S.J.L. , the purpose of \nthose amendments was to enable parties to choose a mechanism adapted to their needs, \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n \n not to impose a condition to be  met for their right to materialize. The right to a \npreliminary inquiry remained “unconditional” ( House of Commons Debates , \nSeptember 28, 2000, at pp.  8828 -29; Debates of the Senate , November 1, 2001, at \np. 1612; see also D. M. Paciocco, “A Voyage of Disco very: Examining the Precarious \nCondition of the Preliminary Inquiry” (2004), 48 Crim. L.Q.  151, at p.  162). The \naddition of procedural steps that had to be taken in order to exercise the right to a \npreliminary inquiry did not change the scope of this right , unlike the 2019 legislative \namendment, whose purpose was precisely to limit the number of such inquiries. The \neffects of these two amendments must not be conflated.  \n[54] The Court of Appeal of Quebec properly noted that accused persons \nregularly reserve their  election as to mode of trial at the first appearance in order to \navoid making a premature decision on the exercise of their right to a preliminary \ninquiry (paras.  40-43). This practice provides a concrete illustration of the fact that the \nright to a preli minary inquiry crystallizes as soon as criminal charges are laid. As our \ncolleague Kasirer  J. suggests, if an accused can in practice reserve the exercise of their \nright, this means that their legal situation is (1)  tangible, concrete and distinctive and \n(2) sufficiently constituted, that is, not uncertain and not conditional on future events. \nAs we explain, however, these conditions are already met the moment criminal charges \nare laid. As long as the accused has not waived the right to a preliminary inquir y by \nelecting to be tried in provincial court and the Crown has not defeated this right by \nelecting an incompatible mode of prosecution or by proceeding by direct indictment, \nthe accused continues to have a right to a preliminary inquiry.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n \n [55] In our view, ther e is no need in this case to decide on the appropriateness \nof reforming this practice. Parliament has already made the choice to limit the \npreliminary inquiry to the most serious cases in order to address the increase in court \ndelays in criminal cases. Arg uably, the making of informed decisions also helps to \nreduce delays, by comparison with the making of premature decisions that might entail \nhigher costs. It must be kept in mind that, when an accused expresses his wish to \nre-elect mode of trial, consent fr om the prosecutor must generally be obtained \n(s. 561(1",

In this context, and in light of the importance \nof this election by an accused, we would refrain from concluding that the practice of \nreserving elections is a dilatory  mechanism.  \n[56] In addition to being supported by the new enactment, the interpretation we \nadopt has the advantage of preserving fairness and legal certainty. Criminal trials do \nnot all proceed in a purely linear fashion, and they each have their own particula r \nfeatures. When it comes to the order of the various stages of the proceedings, there are \na multitude of possibilities. The flexibility of criminal procedure and the possible \ndelays that may occur are better acknowledged by finding that the right vests wh en \ncharges are laid, a stage common to all cases. Such delays may be attributable to the \nCrown, for example where it is slow to elect the mode of prosecution, or to the delays \ninherent in the justice system.  Nothing suggests that Parliament intended to sub ject the \nvesting of a right as important as that to a preliminary inquiry to such contingencies. \nThe expectation of the accused crystallizes into a right to a preliminary inquiry once \ncharges are laid, because the accused’s freedom and security are then at  risk. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n \n [57] Such an interpretation also has the advantage of allowing for the uniform \napplication of criminal procedure across the country, without affecting the \nparticularities of the administration of justice in certain provinces. Such particularities \nare permitted by Parliament in matters of criminal procedure (see ss.  482 and 482.1 \nCr. C.). We believe that it is important for justice to be administered in a manner \nadapted to local circumstances and, for this reason, we consider it inappropriate to \nadopt an interpre tation of the new text of s.  535 Cr. C. that would exclude such a \npossibility outright. Nothing in the wording of this provision is inherently incompatible \nwith the election being reserved and the preauthorization or not of prosecutions. To \nconclude that t he right to a preliminary inquiry only vests when an accused makes such \na request risks creating situations in which accused persons in different provinces, \ndespite being charged on the same date, would not all be vested with the right to a \npreliminary inq uiry. \n[58] The respondents, Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault, were charged prior to \nSeptember 19, 2019. We therefore conclude that they each had a vested right to a \npreliminary inquiry before the legislative amendment came into force. The former \ns. 535 Cr. C. continues to apply to them by operation of the presumption against \ninterference with vested rights, and it is unnecessary to determine whether the offences \nthey were charged with fall within the category of the most serious offences. The \nCrown chose to prior itize the holding of the trials for Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault \nwithin a reasonable time, as well as the right of the victims to finally be heard in court, \nby allowing a preliminary inquiry to be held in each of the two cases. With respect for \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n \n the cont rary view, we conclude that this choice was consistent in every respect with the \ntemporal application of the legislative amendment.  \nB. An Accused Whose Alleged Offence, or Its Equivalent, Is Punishable by 14 Years \nor More of Imprisonment Has the Right to a Pr eliminary Inquiry  \n[59] Although our conclusion on the question of the temporal application of the \nnew text of s.  535 Cr. C. is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, we shall now examine \nthe interpretation this provision should receive.  \n[60] To date, appellate courts  that have considered the matter have found that a \npreliminary inquiry is available only to accused persons who personally  face a term of \nimprisonment of 14 years or more (see R. v. Sheppard , 2023 ABCA 381, 69 Alta. L.R. \n(7th) 1; R. v. S",

In the same vein, the Crown submits that the legislative amendment to s.  535 Cr. C. \nhas the effect of eliminating the right to a preliminary inquiry for accused persons \ncharged with so -called historical of fences for which the term of imprisonment was not \n14 years or more at the time the offence was committed.  \n[61] With respect, we are of the view that this interpretation is incorrect. The \ntext, context and purpose of s.  535 Cr. C. demonstrate that an accused has  the right to \na preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by \n14 years or more of imprisonment. Section 535 Cr. C. must be interpreted in a manner \nconsistent with the intent expressed by Parliament to increase the senten ces applicable \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n \n to certain offences, where necessary. The right to a preliminary inquiry is therefore not \naffected by the accused’s right to the benefit of the lesser punishment.  \n(1) Parliament Intended the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry To Be Tied to the \nSerio usness of the Offence  \n[62] There is no ambiguity in the wording of s.  535 Cr. C. A preliminary inquiry \ncan be held only  “[i]f an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is \npunishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment  is before a justice and a r equest has \nbeen made for [an] inquiry” . Both the adjective “punishable” in English and its \nequivalent “ passible ” in the French version, which states “[l]orsqu’un prévenu inculpé \nd’un acte criminel passible d’un emprisonnement de quatorze ans ou plus ”, relate to \nthe indictable offence and not to the sentence the accused may receive. In addition, the \nEnglish version of the provision is enlightening in this regard, since the word “that” \nvery clearly links the adjective “punishable” to the term “indictable offence”. This \nphrasing refers to the seriousness of the alleged offence, and its logic is not directed at \nthe accused personally. Parliament thus intended the right to a preliminary inquiry to \nbe tied to the seriousness of the alleged offence, not to the degree of jeopardy faced by \nthe accused. This is an objective criterion.  \n[63] The expression “acte criminel passible d’un emprisonnement maximal de ” \nis used more than a hundred times in the French version of the Cr. C. to establish the \nmaximum sentence that app lies and thus to define the objective seriousness of offences. \nAs this Court stated in R. v. Friesen , 2020 SCC 9 , [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424 , at para.  96, the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n \n maximum sentence established by Parliament for an offence determines the objective \nseriousness of the of fence (see also R. v. M. (C.A.) , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para.  36; \nH. Parent and J.  Desrosiers, Traité de droit criminel , t. III, La peine  (3rd ed. 2020), at \np. 53; C.  C. Ruby, Sentencing  (10th ed.  2020), at §2.19). According to the presumption \nof consiste nt expression, the meaning of the words used in statutes remains consistent, \nbecause “the legislature is presumed to use language such that the same words have the \nsame meaning both within a statute and across statutes” ( Canada (Minister of \nCitizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov , 2019 SCC 65 , [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653 , at \npara.  44, citing R.  Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes ",

There is therefore no reason, in interpreting the text of s.  535 Cr. C., to depart \nfrom the us ual meaning of this expression, which refers to the objective seriousness of \nthe offence.  \n[64] This interpretation is not only supported by the text of s.  535 Cr. C. but is \nalso reinforced by an examination of the parliamentary debates that led to the \namendment  in issue. It must be kept in mind that Parliament has always understood the \ncategory of the “most serious offences” by reference to the maximum sentence \nspecified for the offence, which, here again, is reflected in the provision as enacted. \nThe first vers ion of the amendment at issue would have maintained the right to a \npreliminary inquiry only for accused persons charged with offences punishable by life \nimprisonment. As a result of a public outcry and a compromise that followed, \nParliament instead chose t o preserve the right to a preliminary inquiry for “the most \nserious offences”, meaning those punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n \n 14 years or more. In doing so, Parliament presumably had in mind offences in the \nnature of those Mr.  Grenier and Mr . Archambault were charged with, which today fall \nwithin the category of the most serious offences. Parliament made the choice to \nincrease the maximum sentences for such offences “to convey its view of the gravity \nof a particular offence” ( R. v. Bertrand M archand , 2023 SCC 26, at para.  168).  \n[65] While it is not in dispute that Parliament intended to limit the right to a \npreliminary inquiry to the most serious offences , it strikes us as contradictory to adopt \nan approach based on the severity of the maximum sent ence to which the accused is \npersonally  liable (or the jeopardy actually  faced by the accused), as the Crown does in \nthis case.  \n[66] In reality, the Crown’s interpretation does not rest on the text or context of \ns. 535 Cr. C., but rather on the abstract purpose  of reducing the number of offences for \nwhich a preliminary inquiry is available. With respect, such an interpretation disregards \nthe new wording of the provision and the compromise from which it resulted. While \nthe purpose of the amendment plays an import ant role in the interpretation of the new \nprovision, it cannot serve as a basis for rewriting the provision so amended or for \nignoring the clear meaning it conveys (see R. v. D.A.I. , 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. \n149, at para.  26; R. v. McColman , 2023 SCC 8,  at para.  36; Reference re Impact \nAssessment Act , 2023 SCC 23, at para.  193; see also Côté and Devinat, at No.  1366; \nSullivan, at p.  293; M.  Mancini, “The Purpose Error in the Modern Approach to \nStatutory Interpretation” (2022), 59 Alta. L. Rev.  919, at pp . 920-22). In construing a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n \n legislative provision, “courts do not have to interpret — let alone implement — the \nobjective underlying a legislative scheme or provision; what they must interpret is the \ntext through which the legislature seeks to achieve [its]  objective” ( MediaQMI inc. v. \nKamel , 2021 SCC 23, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 899, at para.  39). It is clear that Parliament did \nnot seek to achieve at any cost its purpose of reducing the number of offences for which \na preliminary inquiry is available, but rather con fined itself to a very specific \ncompromise, which is reflected in the wording of the provision ( Sun Indalex Finance, \nLLC v.

It is clear that Parliament did \nnot seek to achieve at any cost its purpose of reducing the number of offences for which \na preliminary inquiry is available, but rather con fined itself to a very specific \ncompromise, which is reflected in the wording of the provision ( Sun Indalex Finance, \nLLC v. United Steelworkers , 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 271, at para.  174; see also \nMancini, at pp.  920-21). \n[67] The Crown relies in part on R. v. Windebank , 2021 ONCA 157, 154 O.R. \n(3d) 573, to argue that any interpretation of s.  535 Cr. C. that increased the number of \noffences for which a preliminary inquiry is available would be contrary to Parliament’s \npurpose. In that case, the accused was c harged with assault causing bodily harm and \nassault by choking, suffocation or strangulation, offences punishable by imprisonment \nfor a term of 10 years (s.  267(b) and (c)  Cr. C.). The Crown advised the accused that it \nintended to apply to have him remande d for an assessment under s.  752.1 Cr. C. if he \nwas convicted. In response, the accused requested a preliminary inquiry, alleging that \nhe was now at risk of indefinite detention (s.  753(4) Cr. C.). The Ontario Court of \nAppeal, per Nordheimer  J.A., rightly rejected that argument on the ground that the \nlanguage and legislative history of s.  535 Cr. C. point to an emphasis on the seriousness \nof the offence, not on the jeopardy faced by the accused:  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n \n  There is nothing ambiguous about the language used in s. 535. The \nwords used are plain. An offender is entitled to a preliminary inquiry if \n“charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more \nof imprisonment”. The respondent is not charged with any such offence.  \n In my view, the flaw, both in the respondent’s argument and in the \ndecisions below, is that they confuse the seriousness of the offence with \nthe seriousness of the offender, that is, their individual circumstances.  \nProceedings by way of a dangerous offender designation are separate and  \napart from the proceedings leading to a conviction for the offence. It is a \nproceeding that may only be invoked after a finding of guilt has been made \non the offence charged. It requires a separate process where separate \nfactual findings are made, and its  determination turns on the nature of the \noffender, not the nature of the offence. While a specific offence may trigger \nthe dangerous offender proceeding, its determination goes well beyond the \noriginating offence: R. v. Wilson , [2020] O.J. No.  30, 2020 ON CA 3, 384 \nC.C.C. (3d) 355, at para.  66. \n As s.  535 makes clear, it is the seriousness of the offence that dictates \nthe entitlement to a preliminary inquiry.  This conclusion is reinforced by \nthe legislative history leading to the changes to s.  535, includin g the change \nfrom offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to \noffences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years. It is also reinforced by \nthe various speeches made in Parliament regarding the purpose behind the \namendments. [Underlining adde d; paras.  35-37.] \n[68] Clearly, and with respect for the distinction drawn by the Ontario Court of \nAppeal in S.S., the jeopardy actually faced by the accused as a result of the time when \nthe offence was committed is part of the accused’s individual circumstance s and does \nnot go to the seriousness of the alleged offence. An offence is not less serious today \nbecause it was committed before a certain date. In determining the right to a preliminary \ninquiry, Parliament did not intend to draw a distinction between cha rges of the same \nnature based on the date of commission of the offence. To conclude otherwise would \nonly create more complexity and uncertainty, which would be contrary to Parliament’s \nintent ( Windebank , at para.  31). \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n \n [69] The objective seriousness of an offenc e is not confined to the maximum \nsentence for the offence at the time it was committed .

On the contrary, the legislative \namendments increasing maximum sentences “indicate Parliament’s determination that \n. . . offences .  . . are to be treated as more grave than they had been in the past” ( Friesen , \nat para.  99; see also Bertrand Marchand , at para.  168). The jeopardy faced by an \naccused who is not personally liable to a maximum sentence of 14 years is similar to \nthat faced by an accused who is personally liabl e to that maximum sentence. In \napplying the principles of sentencing, courts are required to impose sentences higher \nthan those imposed prior to the increases, in accordance with the will of Parliament \n(Friesen , at para.  100; see, e.g., R. v. Fruitier , 202 2 QCCA 1225, at paras.  32-40). \nParliament did not intend to exclude historical offences from the category of the most \nserious offences.  \n[70] Finally, like the appellate courts that have considered the matter (see S.S., \nat paras.  17-20; C.T.B. , at paras.  21 and 42-43), the Crown supports its interpretation \nof the new s.  535 Cr. C. by drawing an analogy between this provision and the one in \ndispute in Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) , 2017 SCC \n50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289. With respect, that an alogy does not hold up. In Tran , the \naccused had committed an offence that was punishable by a maximum sentence of \nseven years at the time it was committed. After the accused was charged, but before he \nwas convicted, a legislative amendment increased the m aximum sentence for that \noffence to imprisonment for 14 years. Under s.  36(1)(a) of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c.  27, the accused was inadmissible to Canada on \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n \n grounds of serious criminality for having been convicted in Canada o f a federal offence \npunishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. That provision, \nwhich has since been amended, was worded as follows:  \n 36 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on \ngrounds of serious criminality  for \n (a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of \nParliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at \nleast 10 years, or of an offence under an Act of Parliament for which \na term of imprisonment of more than six months has b een imposed;  \n[71] On the basis of this wording, the parties were divided on the question of \nwhether the maximum sentence should be assessed by reference to the Act of \nParliament defining the offence or the maximum sentence that could be imposed on the \nperson. I n that particular context, this Court departed from the usual meaning of the \nwords “punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years”. Such an \ninterpretation was justified by the context of the provision, given the temporal marker \n(set at the time of conviction) and the disjunctive clauses (the maximum term of \nimprisonment and the actual term imposed), as well as by the purpose of the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act  (Tran , at paras.  36-40). The opposite \ninterpretation would have led to the conclusion that one and the same conviction could \nboth entitle a permanent resident to remain in the country at the time the conviction \nwas entered and lead to their deportation later, without any indication from Parliament \nthat such a retroactive e ffect was intended (paras.  43-53). In light of all of these \nconsiderations, this Court held that the provision could refer only to the maximum \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n \n sentence that could have been imposed on the accused at the time the offence was \ncommitted (para.  36). \n[72] Uniformly transposing the interpretation of s.  36(1",

C. disregards the text, context and purpose of \neach of the two provisions. Statutory interpretation is meant to determine the intent \nreflected in a pa rticular enactment and cannot be reduced to an artificial comparative \nexercise that does not take account of the context in which the words are used.  \n[73] Where the maximum sentence for an offence was increased to 14  years \nbetween the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, a preliminary inquiry \ncan be held even if the accused is not personally facing a maximum sentence of \n14 years. In such a case, it must be asked whether the seriousness of the alleged offence, \nas it is defined today, places it wit hin the category of the most serious offences. The \nfact that the accused is charged and convicted on the basis of the criminal provisions in \nforce at the time the offence was committed changes nothing in this regard.  \n(2) An Accused’s Right to the Benefit of th e Lesser Punishment Does Not \nAffect the Determination of the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry  \n[74] Although an accused may receive a reduced maximum sentence for a crime \ncommitted before the sentence was increased, the accused’s right to the benefit of the \nlesser  punishment does not defeat the right to a preliminary inquiry. To conclude \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n \n otherwise would lead to an absurd result, in addition to penalizing the accused and \ndisregarding the sequence of the various stages of a trial.  \n[75] In establishing an accused’s right t o a preliminary inquiry, s.  535 Cr. C. is \nclosely linked to the right set out in s.  548(1)(b) Cr. C., that is, the right to be discharged \nof any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, \nno sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial on the charge. In this sense, it \nis a provision favourable to the accused. Section 535 Cr. C. cannot be interpreted \nnarrowly in light of other provisions that are equally favourable to the accused, such as \ns. 11(i) of the Charte r and ss.  43(d) and 44(e) of the Interpretation Act , which establish \nthe accused’s right to the benefit of the lesser punishment. Concluding that accused \npersons who enjoy such protection have no right to a preliminary inquiry leads to an \nabsurdity, which results from the application of provisions whose purpose is precisely \nto preserve their interests.  \n[76] We are also unable to agree with the conclusion of our colleague \nKarakatsanis  J. that Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault would not be penalized by such \nan inter pretation. While an accused’s right to the benefit of the lesser punishment \nguarantees a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment because of the date of the \nalleged offence for which the statutory sentence has since been increased, the accused \ncan be giv en a sentence heavier than the one that would have been imposed at the time, \nas we explained above ( Friesen , at paras.  3, 5 and 107; Bertrand Marchand , at \npara.  31). There is therefore a significant difference between the situation of an accused \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n \n charged wi th an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years and that of \nan accused charged with a historical offence for which the statutory sentence has since \nbeen increased.  \n[77] We reiterate that Tran  does not support the conclusion that the accused \nmust  be personally facing a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years in order to \nhave the right to a preliminary inquiry. Drawing an analogy with s.  36(1)(a) of the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act , as our colleague Karakatsanis  J. does, \noverlooks the se quence of stages in criminal trials.

The order in which \nthese stages proceed plays an important role, because the preliminary inquiry takes \nplace well before se ntencing.

There are circumstances in which the justice cannot say with \ncertainty that the accused will have the rights set out in s.  11(i) of the Charter . Adopting \nthe rea soning proposed by our colleague would create the risk of denying a preliminary \ninquiry to an accused who should be entitled to one. The application of s.  11(i) of the \nCharter  is a question of law, which a judge decides only at the sentencing stage.  \n(3) Applic ation to the Facts  \n[78] It must be kept in mind that, since 2015, offences in the nature of those \nwith which Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault were charged, or the equivalent offences, \nhave been punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years. Under s.  11(i) \nof the Charter , the respondents are entitled to the benefit of the lesser maximum \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n \n punishment in effect at the time the alleged acts were committed, that is, a maximum \nof 10  years’ imprisonment. The fact remains that the intent expressed by Parliament is \nto toughen the s entences applicable to the offences charged against Mr. Grenier and \nMr. Archambault. Section 535 Cr. C. must be interpreted in a manner consistent with \nthat intent.  \n[79] The offences with which Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault were charged \nfall within the catego ry of the most serious offences, because if the acts in question \nwere committed today, they would be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment \nof 14  years . This is not in dispute. They therefore have the right, under the new s.  535 \nCr. C., to request a preliminary inquiry.  \nV. Conclusion  \n[80] For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.  \n English version of the reasons of Kasirer and Jamal JJ. delivered by  \n KASIRER  J. —  \n[81] I have had the advantage of reading the reasons prepared by my colleagues, \nbut, with respect, I do not share their views.

C-46 \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n \n (“Cr. C.”), on September 19, 2019. This allowed for their preliminary inquiries to be \nheld at a later date. I would therefore dismiss the Crown’s appeal, but, again with \nrespect, for  reasons that differ from those of the Court of Appeal.  \n[82] In substance, I agree with Karakatsanis  J.’s analysis of vested rights with \nregard to the temporal application of s.  535 Cr. C. In particular, I agree with the \nimportance my colleague attaches to the request made by an accused for a preliminary \ninquiry. I also agree with her that l ocal practices regarding the administration of justice \ncan legitimately vary from one province or territory to another and that this is not \nnecessarily incompatible with the uniform application of substantive criminal law in \nCanada in a context similar to that of this appeal. However, in light of the practice \nfollowed in Quebec and its effect on the respondents’ right to request a preliminary \ninquiry, I am of the view that the  respondents had vested rights in the circumstances. \nThis conclusion should not be seen as a way of circumventing the effect of legislation \nduly passed by Parliament. Given that Parliament did not enact a transitional provision \nspecifying how the new s.  535 Cr. C. was to apply to an existing situation, it is for the \ncourts to interpret it to determine whether accused persons had vested rights at the time \nit came into force. There is no justification for excluding the Quebec practice from the \nanalysis.  \n",

C. was to apply to an existing situation, it is for the \ncourts to interpret it to determine whether accused persons had vested rights at the time \nit came into force. There is no justification for excluding the Quebec practice from the \nanalysis.  \n[83] The r ule governing vested or acquired rights was stated as follows by this \nCourt in R. v. Puskas , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207: “ A right can only be said to have been \n‘acquired’ when the right -holder can actually exercise it”  (para.  14). As Lamer  C.J. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n \n explained, “a rig ht cannot accrue, be acquired, or be accruing until all conditions \nprecedent to the exercise of the right have been fulfilled” ( ibid.; see also Dikranian v. \nQuebec (Attorney General) , 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at para.  37; R. v. \nDineley , 2012 SCC 5 8, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, at para.  52). \n[84] Both as it read at the time of each respondent’s first appearance before the \nCourt of Québec and in its amended form, s.  535 Cr. C. grants certain accused persons \nwhat the Superior Court judge in Mr.  Grenier’s case rig htly called [TRANSLATION ] “the \nright to request a preliminary inquiry” (2021 QCCS 1876, at para.  32 (CanLII)). Once \na preliminary inquiry has been requested, the justice “shall” inquire into the charge \n(s. 535 Cr. C.). \n[85] I agree with Karakatsanis  J. that onc e an accused requests a preliminary \ninquiry, “ all conditions precedent” to the exercise of the right are then fulfilled within \nthe meaning of Puskas . Accordingly, where a request was made before the amendment \nto s. 535 Cr. C. came into force on September 1 9, 2019, but the inquiry was not held \nbefore that date, the right to an inquiry at a later date had vested. In my opinion, \nhowever, this is not the only situation in which all of the “conditions precedent” are \nfulfilled, such that the right to request a pr eliminary inquiry for the existing situation \nvests. In my respectful view, to conclude otherwise would undermine the judicially \nendorsed practice that allows an accused to reserve their right to elect the mode of trial \nat a later date, a practice that dete rmined the outcome for the two respondents in this \ncase.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n \n [86] In Quebec, by all accounts, accused persons proceed [ TRANSLATION ] “as is \ncustomary” in that province, that is, by “reserv[ing] their election .  . . so that they [can] \nexamine the evidence disclosed” (R. v. Chrétien -Barrette , 2023 QCCQ 5857, at \npara.  27 (CanLII)). It is also [ TRANSLATION ] “customary for judges to agree to requests \nmade by accused persons to reserve their election” as to the mode of trial, a practice \nrecognized both by the courts and in  legal scholarship (para.  29; see also Aucoin v. R ., \n2023 QCCS 3024, at paras.  41 and 43 (CanLII); A. Stylios, J.  Casgrain and \nM.-É. O’Brien, Procédure pénale  (2023), at pp.  704-5; author Nicolas Bellemare uses \nthe term [ TRANSLATION ] “postpone” to refer  to the same practice: “Les procédures \nprécédant le procès en matière criminelle”, in Collection de droit de l’École du Barreau \ndu Québec 2024 -2025, vol.  12, Droit pénal – Procédure et preuve (2024), 39, at \npp. 70-71).

It is therefore not surprising in thi s case that the Crown and \nMr. Archambault both point to this practice in their submissions to the Court, by \nreferring to [ TRANSLATION ] “reserv[ing] [the] election as to the mode of trial” (A.F., at \npara.  8) and [ TRANSLATION ] “reservation of [the] election”  (R.F. (Archambault), at \nparas.  68-71), and do not dispute its existence. Healy J.A., writing for the unanimous \npanel of the Court of Appeal, made the same observation when noting that “[a]t the \nfirst appearance, at least in Quebec, the accused typically r eserves the right of election \nto a future date” and that, in doing so, “the accused has effectively preserved the \nentitlement to request a preliminary inquiry” (2022 QCCA 1170,  84 C.R. (7th) 174, at \nparas.  40 and 43).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n \n [87] This is what occurred in respect of th e two respondents. When they first \nappeared before the Court of Québec, the accused each asked the court to reserve their \nelection as to the mode of trial, and their request was granted (see 2021 QCCS 1966,  at \nparas.  12 and 15; C.Q. reasons (Grenier), repr oduced in A.R., vol.  I, at pp.  7-8; A.F., at \npara.  8). All of this happened before the amendments to s.  535 Cr. C. came into force, \nthat is, before September 19, 2019. The respondents’ understanding — which is \ngenerally shared by Quebec judges and lawyers — was that reserving the election as to \nthe mode of trial had the effect of preserving the right to make a request for a \npreliminary inquiry at a later date, so that the right could be exercised in an informed \nmanner (see, e.g., C.A. reasons, at para.  42; R.F. (Archambault), at para.  68). By \nagreeing to their requests, the Court of Québec was thus assuring them that they could \nrequest a preliminary inquiry at a later date.  \n[88] This understanding is clearly reflected in the record, including in the \nfollowing exc hange between a Court of Québec judge and counsel for \nMr. Archambault:  \n [TRANSLATION ] \n BRIGITTE MARTIN:  \nThe time of the request for a preliminary inquiry. And what I wanted to \nadd is that once the accused reserves their election, because that’s what he \ndid, in the case of Mr.  Agénor [Archambault], not just Mr.  Agénor, but in \nthe majority of cases, what’s done at the appearance stage is to appear and \nreserve the election. And the purpose of reserving the election is to make \nan informed decision  . . . \n THE COURT:  \nAh, I understand all of that.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n \n  BRIGITTE MARTIN:  \n. . . to examine .  . . \n THE COURT:  \nOf course.  \n BRIGITTE MARTIN:  \n. . . to examine the evidence. And what I wanted to put to you is that once \nthat election is reserved, the possibility of making an elect ion that will lead \nto a preliminary inquiry is reserved for them.  \nSo if the election is reserved, well at that point, it follows that .  . . \n THE COURT:  \nWell in fact, what you’re arguing is a vested right. By reserving the \nelection.  \n BRIGITTE MARTIN:  \nIt’s . . . you’re ahead of me. It’s a vested right.  \n THE COURT:  \nExactly.  \n BRIGITTE MARTIN:  \nAnd that was Mr.  Archambault’s position, through what you were able to \nread in the arguments. But I still wanted to come back to this concept of \nreserving the right .",

But I still wanted to come back to this concept of \nreserving the right .  . . [Emphasis added.]  \n (A.R., vol.  I, at pp.  17-18) \n[89] To be clear, I am not quoting this exchange as evidence of what actually \noccurred earlier, when Mr.  Archambault reserved his election as to the mode of trial. \nMoreover, there is no disputing the fact that suc h exchanges between a judge and \ncounsel are not binding on the court and do not constitute evidence in the strict sense. \nHowever, this exchange is an indication, drawn from the record before us, that at the \ntime, the parties, counsel and the judge concerne d all understood that the reservation \nhad been approved by the court in keeping with the established practice.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n \n [90] It is true that the judge did not accept Mr.  Archambault’s argument, but this \nwas because he was of the view that even an accused with a vested r ight lost their right \nto a preliminary inquiry when s.  535 Cr. C. came into force, given that the judge had \nheld that the provision applied with immediate effect. Indeed, while the Court of \nQuébec judge recognized that reserving the right to elect the mode  of trial could result \nin a vested right to request a preliminary inquiry, he adopted an interpretation of s.  535 \nCr. C. that denied Mr.  Archambault the benefit of such an inquiry. According to the \njudge, who relied on R. v. Lamoureux , 2019 QCCQ 6616, the right to request a \npreliminary inquiry is purely procedural, such that the new s.  535 Cr. C. applied with \nimmediate effect, an interpretation that Karakatsanis  J. rightly rejects. That being so, \nthe question of whether a vested right exists, in accordance with Puskas  and on the \nbasis of Mr.  Archambault’s decision to reserve his election, remains an open one. \nAlthough the question has become factually moot in this case, this does not alter the \nimportance of answering it for the benefit of other individuals w ho might find \nthemselves in the same situation as the respondents.  \n[91] According to this understanding of reserving the election as to the mode of \ntrial, which is an understanding I adopt, the effect of a reservation authorized by the \ncourt is to preserve the accused’s rights pursuant to the rule stated in Puskas . All of the \nconditions precedent to the holding of a preliminary inquiry are indeed fulfilled when \nthe election is reserved: the accused receives the court’s assurance that they can make \na request at a  later date and, by the terms of s.  535 Cr. C., that request must  be honoured. \nThe accused’s legal situation is therefore tangible, concrete and sufficiently constituted \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n \n at that time (P. -A. Côté and M.  Devinat, Interprétation des lois  (5th ed. 2021), at \nNos. 619-20, citing, among others, Dikranian , at paras.  37 et seq.). These criteria serve \nto distinguish the vested rights of the respondents in this case from what would be mere \nexpectations. Reserving the right to elect the mode of trial is thus different from where \nthe accused simply puts off their election without a judicial undertaking that entails the \npreservation of their rights. Moreover, the effectiveness of reserving the election as to \nthe mode of trial does not turn on the fact that certain accused  persons, having received \nthis assurance from the court, were or were not represented by counsel at the time, \nwhich could create an injustice for a class of accused persons who nevertheless face \nthe same potential deprivation of liberty.  \n[92] It remains true th at, by assuring the accused that a request for a preliminary \ninquiry can be made at a later date, the fact of reserving the right to elect the mode of \ntrial ensures that all of the conditions precedent are fulfilled within the meaning of \nPuskas .

It may wel l be that other local practices have the same effect. It is equally \npossible that the Court of Appeal for Ontario was correct to find in R. v. R.S. , 2019 \nONCA 906, that the right to a preliminary inquiry cannot vest until the accused has \nmade a request to that effect in that province. However, this does not take away from \nthe fact that, in Quebec, this right vests each time a court agrees to reserve an accused’s \nright to elect their mode of trial, in keeping with the standard practices. I wish to make \nclear  that this must not be seen as a special rule for Quebec, but only as a reflection of \nthe application of Puskas  to a legitimate procedure used in part of the country.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n \n [93] I would add that to conclude otherwise could lead to injustices and \nundermine public conf idence in the administration of justice. The respondents relied \non the assurance that they each obtained from the court on the basis of a \nwell-established local practice. The respondents relied — to their detriment  — on the \nlocal practice of reserving thei r rights, with the court’s approval.  It is true that the \nrespondents will not actually suffer any injustice, since the appeal is moot as far as they \nare concerned. However, I am mindful that other individuals — the numbers are of \ncourse uncertain — could f ind themselves in the same situation. In my opinion, public \nconfidence in the administration of justice and in the rule of law might well be \nundermined if accused persons — especially those whose liberty is at stake — cannot \nrely on the assurances they rec eive from the very court that administers the proceedings \nbrought against them. The Crown may be right in arguing that the amendment of s.  535 \nCr. C. is a change that [ TRANSLATION ] “should have been anticipated” and “caught no \none by surprise” (A.F., at pa ra. 88), but accused persons in Quebec who believed that \ntheir right was reserved will surely be caught by surprise if they later discover that this \nright has been taken away from them despite the assurances they received. Nonetheless, \nI would add that my interpretation of s.  535 Cr. C. and of its impact on vested rights is \nbased on the application of Puskas  and not solely on the observation that an injustice \ncould result from a contrary interpretation. In other words, the question at the heart of \nthis appe al remains the interpretation of what constitutes a vested right following the \namendment to s.  535 Cr. C., a question that was settled in Puskas . \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n \n [94] However, I also hasten to note that, given Parliament’s silence regarding \nthe application of s.  535 Cr. C. to existing situations, interpreting the new legislation \non the basis of presumptions would face a second difficulty. The fact is that authors \nwarn the courts against interpreting new legislation in a manner that may cause \ninjustice. Pierre -André Côté has  written that [ TRANSLATION ] “the courts try to reserve \nprotection from the application of the new legislation for those who would actually be \nprejudiced by its application, that is,  those whose expectations based on the former \nlegislation have had practica l consequences, have led them to take specific actions, to \ncompromise themselves, to change their situation” (“ Le juge et les droits acquis en \ndroit public canadien ” (1989), 30 C. de D.  359, at p.  419).  \n[95] Here, the purpose of reducing the number of prelimina ry inquiries that \nParliament seeks to advance should not have a disproportionately unjust impact on \naccused persons like Mr.  Grenier and Mr.  Archambault, given the absence of a \ntransitional provision for existing situations. In a context analogous to that of this case, \nauthors Côté and Devinat explain as follows:  \n [TRANSLATION ] However, denying the existence of vested rights and \nopting for the immediate application of the new legislation also has",

The life of the law needs \na degree of stability in order to develop: legal reform, if not carried out \ngradually, can entail serious prejudice for individuals. The perception of \ninjustice in rel ation to affected individuals weighs heavily in the judicial \ndetermination of whether it is appropriate for the former legislation to \nsurvive.  \n (No. 614, quoting Ciecierski v. Fenning , 2005 MBCA 52, 258 D.L.R. (4th) \n103, at para.  31, per Steel  J.A. (“ The p resumption against interference with \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n \n vested rights is not as weighty as the presumption against retroactivity and \nthe question of unfairness is a critical component”); see also R.  Sullivan, \nThe Construction of Statutes  (7th ed. 2022), at §  25.13.)  \n[96] In this case, both of the accused reserved their right at the time of their \nrespective first appearance before the Court of Québec, and thus before September  19, \n2019, when the new s.  535 Cr. C. came into force. They were therefore governed by \nthe former s.  535 Cr. C., which recognized their right to request a preliminary inquiry. \nIn the circumstances, I am of the view that they could request a preliminary inquiry . \n[97] Before concluding, I would add the following. It is apparent that this \npractice , which was followed in this case by the two respondents, may not be ideal in \nlight of the time limits imposed by R. v. Jordan , 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. \nAs the Crown noted before this Court, [ TRANSLATION ] “it is a practice that is certainly \na sour ce of problems in that it results in significant delays. If you look at the number \nof times, for example, that these cases here were postponed pro forma without any \ndecision having been made, without the judge putting the accused to an election, it can \nbe seen here that there was a postponement, a postponement and no decision that was \nmade in each instance” (transcript, at p.  18). Given its impact on court delays, it might \nbe appropriate to rethink the wisdom of the practice of reserving the right to elect the \nmode of trial in the future.  \n[98] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal . \n The following are the reasons delivered by  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n \n  MARTIN J. — \nI. Overview  \n[99] Parliament’s decision to remain silent about when many provisions in \nformer Bill C -75, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act \nand other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts , S.C. 2019, c.  25 \n(“2019 Amendments”), apply has created considerable legal uncertainty across all \nlevels of court (see R. v. Chouhan , 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at paras. 86 -87). \nThis is the second time this Court has been asked to provide clarity on the temporal \napplication of amendments introduced by this Act. The first time, in Chouhan , a \nmajority of this Court determined that the Act’s  changes to the jury selection process \nwere procedural in nature and could therefore apply retrospectively (paras. 103, 109 \nand 124).  \n[100]  However, in this case, my colleagues and I agree that the amendments at \nissue, which restrict preliminary inquiry eligibil ity only to offences attracting a \nmaximum punishment of at least 14 years, are not purely procedural and instead can \naffect an accused’s substantive legal interests.

Accused persons no longer entitled to \npreliminary inquiries under the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 \n(“Cr. C. ”), have lost the opportunity to be discharged at the close of a preliminary \ninquiry should the evidence prove insufficient to order the accused to stand trial. This \nloss is significant as a discharge usually puts an early end to criminal liability for those \ncharges. A discharge will also often mean that there will be no trial at all, or that the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n \n accused will be released from custody pending trial or relieved from restrictive pre -trial \nrelease conditions (Karakatsan is J.’s reasons, at para.  158).  \n[101]  In light of Parliament’s failure to legislate on the timing of these \namendments, the judicial task is to determine when the new s. 535 applies based on the \nprinciples and presumptions concerning the temporal application of legislation, as well \nas the values of fairness, rule of law and reasonable reliance they protect. This task \nmust be approached with the interests of justice top of mind.  \n[102]  The parties and the courts below proposed different points in time for the \napplicatio n of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code :  \n the date of the alleged offence (argued by the respondents Agénor \nArchambault and Gilles Grenier, and accepted by the Court of Appeal \nof Quebec);  \n the date of the accused’s first appearance (an alternative argumen t \nraised by Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier, and addressed by the \nCourt of Appeal of Quebec); and  \n the date the accused requests a preliminary inquiry (argued by the \nCrown, and adopted by my colleague Karakatsanis J.).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n \n My colleagues Côté and Rowe JJ. pref er the date on which the charge is laid and \nKasirer  J. suggests that any vesting must take into account if and when the accused \nreserves their right to request a preliminary inquiry at a future date.  \n[103]  To some extent, all of these possibilities represent rea sonable alternatives \nand have their respective benefits and drawbacks. None of these possibilities offers a \nperfect answer. In my view, however, the date of the offence is the preferable option.  \n[104]  The date of the offence best protects the accused’s ability t o have a \npreliminary inquiry, and in turn, potentially to be discharged, released from pre -trial \ncustody, or relieved from onerous bail conditions.  It is a principled choice that is \nconsistent with the time ordinarily used as a reference point for legislat ive changes \nmade to the availability of ancillary orders, constituent elements of offences, applicable \nmaximum sentences, and legal defences to criminal charges (see R. v. K.R.J. , 2016 SCC \n31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at paras. 1 -3; R. v. Poulin , 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, \nat para. 45;  R. v. Dineley , 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, at paras. 18 -20). It reflects \nthat the accused person’s interests at stake are significant and carry great weight in the \ninterpretative exercise. Further, it does not subjec t these interests to a determination of \nwhen, why, or how the Crown decides to prosecute a charge, or the many factors that \nmay influence the timing of an accused’s choice as to their mode of trial. It also \nestablishes  a bright -line rule that operates fair ly and consistently across the country, \nirrespective of regional differences in procedure.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n \n [105]  Accordingly, I see no basis to interfere with the decision of the Court of \nAppeal  of Quebec holding that the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to \nthe offence date, and I would dismiss the appeal.

Accused persons alleged to have \ncommitted an offence that rendered them eligible for a preliminary inquiry before \nSeptember 19, 2019, the date on which the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code came into \nforce, shoul d retain that eligibility today. I agree with my colleague Karakatsanis J. that \ngoing forward, under s.  535, an accused is only eligible for a preliminary inquiry if they \npersonally face a maximum punishment of 14 years or greater.  \nII. Analysis  \nA. The New Section 535 of the Code Impacts Substantive Rights  \n[106]  I agree that limiting the availability of the preliminary inquiry can interfere \nwith the accused’s substantive rights and is not purely procedural. An accused who is \nno longer entitled to a preliminary inq uiry under the new s. 535 loses the substantive \nright to be discharged at the close of the preliminary inquiry, if the Crown does not \nmeet the required threshold to order the accused to stand trial ( Cr. C. , s. 548(1)(b); R. \nv. Arcuri , 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2  S.C.R. 828, at para. 33; R. v. R.S. , 2019 ONCA 906, \nat paras. 47 -58).  \n[107]  A discharge will issue following a preliminary inquiry when, “on the whole \nof the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence \ncharged or any oth er indictable offence in respect of the same transaction” ( Cr. C. , \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n \n s. 548(1)(b)). A discharge cannot be appealed and is reviewable only for certiorari : \n“. . . the reviewing court should only intervene where the preliminary inquiry judge \ncommitted a jurisdi ctional error” ( R. v. Sazant , 2004 SCC 77, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 635, at \npara.  14). Other than certiorari , if the Crown wishes to proceed with the charges against \nthe accused, its only option is to prefer an indictment under s. 577 of the Criminal \nCode , which re quires the personal written consent of either the Attorney General or the \nDeputy Attorney General. Aside from these two narrow avenues to continue the \nproceedings, being discharged at the close of the preliminary inquiry effectively ends \nthe criminal case against the accused.  \n[108]  In my view, the loss of the possibility of being discharged at the close of a \npreliminary inquiry is significant. Although not a perfect analogy, it approximates the \nloss of a legal defence, which the majority in Dineley held affected the substantive and \nconstitutional rights of the accused (paras. 18 -21; see also Angus v. Sun Alliance \nInsurance Co. , [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256, at pp. 266 -67). Dineley  considered a legislative \nchange to the Criminal Code that eliminated access to the “ Carter defence” in impaired \ndriving cases, which had formerly allowed the accused to rely on an expert opinion to \nargue that the amount of alcohol consumed was inconsistent with the breathalyzer test \nresults. A majority of the Court in Dineley  held that removing th is defence affected the \naccused’s substantive rights and therefore the legislative change applied prospectively \nonly. Just as mounting a successful  Carter defence would often have left a trial judge \nwith a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s criminal resp onsibility prior to the change, \nbeing discharged at the close of a preliminary inquiry, in most cases, will end the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n \n criminal case against the accused on those charges (see paras. 17 -18; Arcuri , at \nparas.  20-21).  \n[109]  The impact of the amendments on the accused ’s constitutionally protected \ninterests must also be considered in determining whether the legislation affects the \naccused’s substantive rights. In Dineley , this Court considered that “[w]hen \nconstitutional rights are affected , the general rule against the  retrospective application \nof legislation should apply” (para. 21 (",

In Dineley , this Court considered that “[w]hen \nconstitutional rights are affected , the general rule against the  retrospective application \nof legislation should apply” (para. 21 (emphasis added); see also Chouhan , at para. 93). \nThe respondents in this case make no claim that the removal of this screening \nmechanism violated rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms . \nHowever, they argue that the impact of its loss on the accused’s substantive legal \ninterests, which include constitutionally protected interests, must be considered when \ninterpreting this new legislation to determine when and to whom it appl ies.  \n[110]  Although this Court in R. v. S.J.L. , 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 426, held \nthat the accused does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry, the \nquestion of whether legislation is constitutional is distinct from the question of its \ntemporal application (paras. 21 -22; see also R.S., at para. 55). In determining the \ntemporal application of legislation, the lack of a formal finding of unconstitutionality \ndoes not prevent a court from considering whether the accused’s constitutionally \nprote cted interests may be affected by the change in the law. In other words, an \namendment to a provision like s. 535 may affect a Charter  right in the substantive \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n \n manner required to give rise to the presumption against retrospectivity without there \nbeing an actual infringement of the implicated Charter  right.  \n[111]  For example, Dineley did not involve a constitutional challenge to the \nlegislative  changes to the Carter defence. It was in the companion case of R. v. \nSt-Onge  Lamoureux , 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187, that the majority of this Court \nheld that the amendments infringed neither s.  7 nor s. 11(c) of the Charter . While the \nCourt held tha t the amendments did infringe s. 11(d) of the Charter , it found that the \ninfringement of s. 11(d) was justified under s. 1 (para. 101). Nevertheless, despite not \nhaving found a constitutional violation in St-Onge Lamoureux , when considering the \ntemporal ap plication  of the amendments in Dineley , the Court emphasized that the \namendments intersected with the presumption of innocence and that the constitutional, \nand therefore “necessarily substantive”, rights of the accused were affected ( Dineley , \nat paras. 20 -21). \n[112]  Eliminating the possibility of a discharge at the close of the preliminary \ninquiry may also affect the accused’s  constitutionally protected interests. The \nopportunity to obtain a timely judicial evaluation of the Crown’s case, and to be \ndischarged sho uld that case prove insufficient, implicates an accused’s rights to liberty \nand security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter , especially for those in custody \npending trial or on stringent bail terms ( R.S., at para. 52). Even where a discharge is \nordere d in respect of only some charges, the accused’s jeopardy is reduced accordingly, \nwhich may lead to loosening their bail conditions or to their pre -trial release from \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n \n detention ( R.S., at para.  58; Cr. C. , s. 523(2)(b)). This, in turn, may cause the Crown t o \nrevisit the strength of the remaining case against the accused, thereby opening avenues \nfor plea negotiations or withdrawals of other charges.  \n[113]  Further, the “paramount purpose [of the preliminary inquiry] is to ‘protect \nthe accused from a needless, and i ndeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the \nenforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the \nprocess’” ( R. v. Hynes , 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 30, citing Skogman \nv. The Queen , [1984] 2 S.C.R. 9 3, at p. 105).",

A preliminary inquiry is a pre -trial \nscreening mechanism and does not determine guilt ( S.J.L. , at para. 21). Nevertheless, a \ncase ought not proceed to trial without meeting the low threshold for an order to stand \ntrial — meaning there is no evidence “upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed \ncould return a verdict of guilty” ( Arcuri , at paras. 20 -21; see also United States of \nAmerica v. Shephard , [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080).  \n[114]  In summary, limiting the availability of the prelimina ry inquiry is not \npurely procedural; it affects the accused’s substantive rights.  \nB. The Proper Interpretive Approach for Legislation That Affects Substantive Rights  \n[115]  Given “the need for certainty as to the legal consequences that attach to \npast facts and con duct, courts have long recognized that the cases in which legislation \nhas retrospective effect must be exceptional” ( Dineley , at para. 10). As thoroughly \ndiscussed by some of my colleagues, the case law and the Interpretation Act , R.S.C. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n \n 1985, c. I -21, pro vide legal presumptions which guide the interpretation of legislation \nwhen Parliament has failed to clearly set out its temporal application (see also Dineley ; \nChouhan , at paras. 86 -87; R. v. Puskas , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, at paras. 5 -7; Dikranian \nv. Quebec  (Attorney General) , 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at paras. 29 -40). I \nwill focus on two presumptions which apply to legislation that affects an accused’s \nsubstantive rights.  \n[116]  The first is the presumption against the retrospective application of \nlegisl ation affecting substantive legal interests. This presumption is clearly reflected in \nthis Court’s most recent jurisprudence on the temporal application of amendments to \nthe Criminal Code . The guiding principle is that new legislation that affects substant ive \nrights is presumed to apply prospectively, absent clear legislative intent otherwise. New \nlegislation that deals with procedure will also not apply immediately if, in its \napplication, it affects  substantive rights ( Dineley , at paras. 10 -11; Chouhan , at paras.  87 \nand 91).  \n[117]  The second is the presumption against interfering with vested rights. This \npresumption frequently arises in the civil context, for example, when discussing the \ninability of legislation to interfere with rights already accrued under con tract (see, e.g., \nDikranian , at para. 32; see also R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), \nat pp. 762 -63). In criminal cases, this Court’s jurisprudence on vested rights has \npreviously required that a right -holder be able to “actually exe rcise” the right and that \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n \n the “eventual accrual [be] certain, and not conditional on future events” (see, e.g., \nPuskas , at para. 14).  \n[118]  There is a difference of opinion as to which pre -amendment criminal cases \n— and which accused — these two presumptions pr otect. I analyze the new s. 535 of \nthe Criminal Code based on the approach articulated and applied in Dineley , this \nCourt’s most recent authority concerning the temporal application of legislation which \naffects substantive interests. Dineley  makes clear th at in order to engage the \npresumption against retrospectivity, it is sufficient that the legislation affects \nsubstantive rights. While Chouhan came later and addressed the changes to the jury \nselection procedures under the 2019 Amendments, a majority in th at case applied the \npresumption that procedural law applies retrospectively. The majority was not \nconcerned with, and did not address, the framework of analysis for amendments",

The majority was not \nconcerned with, and did not address, the framework of analysis for amendments which \naffect substantive rights (para. 103).  \n[119]  Conversely, in Dineley , which invol ved a substantive right and not a purely \nprocedural one, a majority of this Court held that legislative amendments that \neliminated the availability of the Carter  defence in impaired driving cases applied \nprospectively, as of the date of the offence. In doi ng so, the majority explicitly set out \nthe governing test for legislation that affects substantive rights. In describing the rules \nof interpretation that can be helpful in identifying the situations to which new \nlegislation applies, t he Court explained at para. 10 that:  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n \n More specifically, where legislative provisions affect either vested or \nsubstantive rights, retrospectivity has been found to be undesirable. New \nlegislation that affects substantive rights will be presumed to have onl y \nprospective effect unless it is possible to discern a clear legislative intent \nthat it is to apply retrospectively. However, new procedural legislation \ndesigned to govern only the manner in which rights are asserted or enforced \ndoes not affect the substa nce of those rights. Such legislation is presumed \nto apply immediately to both pending and future cases. [Citations omitted.]  \n[120]  The above represents this Court’s most recent statement concerning the \ntiming of amendments that affect substantive rights. Overal l, Dineley  stands for two \nkey propositions that directly impact my conclusion on the outcome of this appeal.  \n(1) Either Substantive or Vested Rights Will Trigger the Presumption Against \nRetrospectivity  \n[121]  Writing for the majority in Dineley , Deschamps J. stated there would be no \nretrospectivity when the legislative provisions affect “either” vested or substantive \nrights (para. 10). On its face, this is a disjunctive requirement built upon the separate \nexistence of the two presumptions noted above. The express inc lusion of the word \n“either” can only mean that the presence of one or the other engages the presumption \nagainst retrospectivity. This either -or formulation is based upon, reflects, and best \nrespects the separate existence of these two presumptions. While s ome amendments \nmay affect both substantive and vested rights, in employing this clear language, the \nCourt in Dineley  conveyed that either of these two avenues is available to a claimant \nseeking to have legislation apply prospectively only.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n \n [122]  Dissenting in Dineley , Cromwell J. was of the view that the amendments \nwere purely procedural and therefore applied retrospectively. Nevertheless, his reasons \nalso identify the two presumptions as “distinct” and refer to them as “substantive or \nvested rights”, effectivel y positioning them as two alternative paths to reaching the \nsame result (see, e.g., paras. 46, 52 and 54 -55). \n[123]  Further, the majority in Dineley  treated its conclusion that the amendments \naffected substantive rights as fully dispositive of the appeal. Paragr aph 10 of Dineley , \ncited above, largely references legislation that affects substantive rights, with little \ndiscussion of the second presumption relating to vested rights. Once Deschamps J. \nfound that the elimination of a defence affected the accused’s sub stantive rights, she \ndid not consider it necessary to conduct a subsequent, separate analysis of whether the \ndefence had somehow “vested” or “accrued” in the accused ( Puskas , at paras. 6 and \n14). The majority canvassed other relevant decisions on the tempo ral application of \nlegislation without ever referencing the need for vesting. The majority did not even cite \nto Puskas  and it cannot simply be assumed that they somehow neglected to do so. A \nmore compelling explanation is that the majority did not need to refer to Puskas , \nbecause the impact on substantive interests alone was sufficient to allow the Court to \nconclude that the legislation could not apply retrospectively.   \n[124]  Thus, in my view, Dineley  makes clear that legislation which affects “ either  \n",

A \nmore compelling explanation is that the majority did not need to refer to Puskas , \nbecause the impact on substantive interests alone was sufficient to allow the Court to \nconclude that the legislation could not apply retrospectively.   \n[124]  Thus, in my view, Dineley  makes clear that legislation which affects “ either  \nvested or substantive rights” offers two alternative routes to the presumption of \nprospective application (para. 10 (emphasis added); see also I.F. (Canadian Civil \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n \n Liberties Association), at paras. 23 -28). As a result, once there has been a finding that \nthe substanti ve rights of the accused are affected, it is unnecessary to impose the \nadditional requirement that those rights must also have somehow vested or accrued to \nthe accused.  \n[125]  The majority’s approach in Dineley  is also complementary and consistent \nwith this Cour t’s decision in Dikranian , in which the Court held that new legislation \nmodifying certain rules concerning interest for student loan payments did not apply \nretrospectively based on the presumption against interfering with vested rights \n(Dikranian , at paras . 32-40 and 49 -54). Just as the majority in Dineley did not consider \nwhether the substantive right to a legal defence had also vested in the accused,  the Court \nin Dikranian  did not consider whether the interest rate entitlement under the old regime \nwas a s ubstantive right or a procedural one. The simple explanation for why the Court \ndid not analyze both presumptions in either case is that it did not have to: either one, \nstanding alone, was sufficient to trigger the presumption of prospective application, \nwhich was not rebutted in either case.  \n[126]  I therefore do not think it is necessary to also show that any substantive \ninterest the legislation affects must also have vested in the accused before the \npresumption against retrospectivity can apply. There is no need to combine or collapse \nthe presumption against retrospectivity where substantive rights are affected and the \npresumption against interfering with vested rights because they have distinct purposes \nand separate spheres of application. They may share the goal of protecting people who \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n \n have relied on the state of law prior to the amendments, but in my view, courts should \npreserve the independent integrity of ea ch. Although in some cases these presumptions \nmay arise together, there will equally be some interferences with substantive interests \nthat do not qualify as interference with a vested right, or for which the idea of vesting \nmay create theoretical or practi cal problems, or even generate unfairness. The separate \ndefinitions and distinct roles of the presumption against retrospectivity and the \npresumption against interference with vested rights has been recognized in the \njurisprudence, in legislation and by le gal scholars (see, e.g., Interpretation Act , s. 43(b) \nto (e);  R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation  (3rd ed. 2016), at p. 342 ; see also pp.  357-\n61 and 363 ; Sullivan (2022) , at pp. 726 -27 and 729 -30). \n[127]  In my view, Dineley  is most closely analogous to the case before us. Both \nthe repeal of the “ Carter  defence” in Dineley  and the amendments to preliminary \ninquiry eligibility in this case eliminated one way in which the criminal charges could \nbe resolved in the accused’s favo ur and implicated the accused’s constitutionally \nprotected interests. Puskas , which concerned the elimination of the accused’s right of \nappeal to this Court without leave after a lower court of appeal had overturned their \nacquittal at trial, is a different  type of case (para. 1). While the amendment in Puskas  \naffected the accused’s substantive rights, it did not implicate the accused’s \nconstitutionally protected interests. Removing a right to appeal at the last possible stage \nin a criminal case is not the s ame as taking away a substantive legal defence at trial \n(Dineley ) or the choice of whether to have a preliminary inquiry — matters which are \nnot only substantive but also implicate the accused’s constitutional rights.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n \n [128]  The nature of the entitlement in Pusk as depended upon four preconditions. \nThe specificity of these preconditions is perhaps one reason why it has",

R.V. , \n2021 SCC 10, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 131, at para. 76). The right to appeal to this Court, which \nthe amendments limited in Puskas , could only have arisen after : (1) the accused had \nbeen charged with an indictable offence; (2) the accused had been acquitted at trial; (3) \nthe accused’s conviction had been re versed on appeal; and (4) a new trial had been \nordered (para. 15). In that particular context, where there were legal preconditions \nnecessary before the particular right to appeal could even arise, it made some sense for \nthe Court to focus on vesting and e nsuring that all “conditions precedent” had been met \n(para. 15). I do not read dicta from that case as creating a general requirement that all \nsubstantive rights must also have vested before legislative amendments must be \npresumed to apply prospectively.  \n[129]  In any event, if a vesting of the substantive right is also required, it should \nbe characterized sufficiently broadly to ensure that rigid legal characterizations and \nformalities are not favoured over fairness and an accused’s substantive interests (see \nSullivan (2016), at p.  365; Sullivan (2022), at pp. 735 -36). Any dispute over whether \nwhat must vest in this case is the right to a preliminary inquiry or the right to request \nto have a preliminary inquiry should be resolved to best respect fairness to an acc used. \nA substantive legal interest that intersects with, implicates or affects constitutional \nrights, does not depend on the fulfilment of future conditions precedent in order to bear \non the analysis. In respect of the constitutional rights at play in this  matter, s. 7 Charter \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n \n rights are held by “[e]veryone” and s.  11 protects “[a]ny person charged with an \noffence”.  \n[130]  Given the significance of the preliminary inquiry and the possibility of a \ndischarge to the accused, it appears unjust to require the fulfilme nt of all statutory \nprerequisites to render the accrual of that right certain, including to require that the \naccused actually have exercised that choice themselves. As noted by my colleague \nKasirer J., public confidence in the administration of justice sho uld not be \ncompromised (para. 93).  \n[131]  In sum, where Parliament is silent as to the temporal application of an \namendment to criminal legislation, a determination that such an amendment affects the \nsubstantive rights of the accused will normally be sufficient t o conclude that the \nlegislation applies prospectively. This conclusion considers the actual impact of the \nimpugned legislation on the accused’s interests and underscores how courts should \nprotect as fully as possible both the substantive and vested rights of those affected by \nchanges in legislation. It also reflects the animating principles behind the presumption \nagainst retrospectivity — fairness and the rule of law — and is consistent with the rule \nthat cases departing from such a presumption “must be exc eptional” ( Dineley , at \npara.  10; see also K.R.J. , at para.  25; Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness) , 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at para. 45).

The question before the Court in Dineley was whether the \namendments at issue applied “retrospectively, that is, to conduct which occurred before \nthe Amendments came into force ” (para. 3 (emphasis added)). The Court held that the \namen dments did  not apply retrospectively and instead applied prospectively only, \nmeaning to conduct occurring only after  the amendments came into force ( Dineley , at \nparas. 3 and 25). The temporal application of amendments therefore hinged on the date \nof the im pugned “conduct” — or the date of the alleged offence.  \n[133]  Similarly, because the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code affects the \naccused’s substantive rights, and in turn because it must apply prospectively only, the \ndate of the offence should govern its tempora l application. Although the Court of \nAppeal of Quebec took a somewhat different reasoning path, it ultimately decided that \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n \n the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to the date of the offence, and I see \nno reason to interfere with that conclusion .  \n[134]  The court below duly focused on the impact on the accused in determining \nthe temporal application of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code (2022 QCCA 1170, \n84 C.R. (7th) 174, at para. 11). With reference to this Court’s decision in Dineley , as \nwell as the  Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in R.S., the court considered that the \ntemporal application of a legislative amendment depends not “on a formal and \ncategorical distinction between procedural and substantive law but on a functional \nassessment [of] wheth er the amendment affects an acquired right or interest” (para. 26, \nciting Dineley  and R.S.). The key question to be determined, in its view, was “whether \nthe effect of an amendment is to create a negligible or significant risk to a party in the \nrange of po ssible outcomes in a proceeding as a result of forced compliance with the \namendment or voluntary reliance upon it” (C.A. reasons, at para. 29). In other words, \nthe more significant the impact on the party affected, the stronger the argument for \nprospective  application. This reasoning is sound, well supported by this Court’s \njurisprudence, and properly reflective of the concrete impact of the legislation on the \nindividuals most affected by it (see also Sullivan (2016), at p. 365; Sullivan (2022), at \npp. 735 -36).  \n[135]  To the extent I would depart from the reasoning of the court below, it is \nwith respect to its finding that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry “vested or \naccrued” as of the date of the accused’s first appearance (paras. 11 and 39 -40). For the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n \n reasons discussed above, having found that the offence date was the appropriate \nreference point in light of the impact of the amendment on the accused, in my respectful \nview,  it was unnecessary to turn to a further assessment of whether and when the right \nvested. In any event, the right to have a preliminary inquiry could be said to have also \nvested on the date of the offence.  \n[136]  I add that the offence date remains preferable for a variety of reasons. It is \na feature common to all criminal files. It is independ ent of any given procedure such as \nthe accused’s first appearance, and thus adaptable to potential regional differences in \ncriminal procedure across the country. It is also attuned to the reality of delays or \nvariables that may arise throughout the course of the criminal process, at no fault of the \nacc",

    "text": " on the date of the offence.  \n[136]  I add that the offence date remains preferable for a variety of reasons. It is \na feature common to all criminal files. It is independ ent of any given procedure such as \nthe accused’s first appearance, and thus adaptable to potential regional differences in \ncriminal procedure across the country. It is also attuned to the reality of delays or \nvariables that may arise throughout the course of the criminal process, at no fault of the \naccused.  \n[137]  Importantly, the date of the offence is the same across Canada and is not \nsubject to significant variations in procedure, at the first appearance or otherwise, \ndepending on the province or territory. Fo r example, while the respondents before us \nwere able to formally reserve their right to a preliminary inquiry at their first \nappearances given local practice in Quebec, in other jurisdictions, the first appearance \nmay allow for no such option (I.F. (Attorn ey General of Ontario), at paras. 13 -14; see \nalso oral submissions of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario), transcript, at \np. 115). Determining the temporal application of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code \nrequires a solution that applies consiste ntly across the country. The accused’s \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n \n substantive rights should not be dependent on or shaped by regional differences in \nprocedure, especially when it may result in unfairness.  \n[138]  In my view, the accused’s request is not the preferable time as it is, under \nrecent versions of the Criminal Code , the final procedural step that must take place to \nensure they can exercise  their right to a preliminary inquiry. However, that does not \nmean such a request is necessary for that right to have been initially acquired  by the \naccused, with the choice to exercise it at a later stage in the proceedings. Furthermore, \nsuch an analysis would not align well with some of s. 535’s pre -2004 iterations, which \nimposed a mandatory preliminary inquiry. For certain historical offences  committed \nunder previous versions of the Criminal Code , there may be no request  to mark the \ntime the right was acquired. Additionally, the possibility that the Crown may proceed \nsummarily on a hybrid charge, or that the accused may ultimately elect trial in the \nprovincial court, does not mean the accused never acquired the right to a preliminary \ninquiry. The right may  no longer  exist from that point forward, but this does not make \nits existence in the first place conditional on the accused’s request. I not e that this \nrationale is in fact consistent with Puskas , in which the final condition precedent \nassociated with the accused’s right to appeal was that the court of appeal below had \nordered a new trial. The accused was not  required to actually exercise his right — i.e., \nby filing a notice of appeal — in order to have acquired it (para. 15).  \n[139]  I would add this: in my respectful view, when a change in the law deprives \nthe accused of a substantive right and Parliament is silent as to the temporal application \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n \n of that change, it is hard to see why a court should insist that accused persons must act \nin a particular manner to preserve that right. In this case, requiring an actual request for \na preliminary inquiry in order to remain entitled to one after September 19,  2019, has \nsignificant consequences for the accused, which run against the animating principle of \nfairness that guides the presumption against retrospectivity ( K.R.J. , at para. 25; Tran , \nat para. 45). Namely, there is a risk that the accused will be forced  to choose between \ntheir right to a preliminary inquiry, and their right to make a free and fully informed \nelection.  \n[140]  The accused’s ability to request a preliminary inquiry is, in all provinces \nand territories other than Nunavut, intrinsically linked to th eir election as to mode of \ntrial. An accused who elects trial in the superior court, either by judge alone or by judge \nand jury, may be eligible for a preliminary inquiry, whereas an accused who elects trial \nin the provincial court is not (see Cr. C. , ss. 536(2) and 536.1(2)). In turn, the accused’s \nelection as to mode of trial has been recognized as one of the most fundamental \ndecisions they can make in their case — often considered, along with how to plead and \nwhether to testify, as one of few decisions s o important that the accused’s",

White , 2022 SCC 7, at para. 5; R. v. W.  (R.), 2023 \nONCA 250, 167 O.R. (3d) 1, at paras. 20 -21, citing G. A. Martin, “The Role and \nResponsibility of the Defence Advocate” (1970), 1 2 Crim. L.Q.  376, at pp. 387 -88).  \n[141]  Given the significance of the election, the accused should be free to make \nit without fear of potentially jeopardizing other rights. As the Court of Appeal of \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n \n Quebec held, to suggest that a failure to formalize an electio n or request until after \nSeptember 19, 2019, diminishes the accused’s entitlement to a preliminary inquiry \nwould “eviscerate the election of its content [and imperil] a variety of entitlements”, \nincluding the right to choose trial by judge and jury or judg e alone and, if the latter, at \nwhich level of court that trial will occur (para. 37). The accused should also, within the \nlimits expressly set out in the Criminal Code, in rules of court and by individual \njustices, remain in control of the timing  of their own election, which in turn may be \nsubject to a range of considerations. For example, in the context of s. 11(b) of the \nCharter , accused persons may be entitled to hold off on electing the mode of trial if \nthey have not yet received sufficient disclosure t o enable them to make a fully informed \ndecision — a problem that, at its core, may in fact overlap with the same delay -related \nconcerns Parliament intended to address with the amendment to s. 535 (see, e.g., R. v. \nL. (L.), 2023 ONCA 52, 166 O.R. (3d) 561, at paras. 15 -18). Indeed, this Court in R. v. \nStinchcombe , [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, noted that timely requests for initial disclosure \nshould be complied with “so as to enable the accused sufficient time before election  \n. . . to consider the information” (p.  343 (emphasis added)).  \n[142]  If the accused, at first, elects a mode of trial that allows them to preserve \ntheir right to request a preliminary inquiry within a limited time, and then later wishes \nto re-elect to be tried by provincial court judge, in many cases t heir ability to do so is \nsubject to the written consent of the Crown ( Cr. C. , s. 561(1)(a); R. v. Jordan , 2016 \nSCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 62). If the Crown refuses to consent, as the \nCriminal Code allows, a court may only review the scope of pro secutorial discretion \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n \n when there is an abuse of process (see R.W. , at para. 31, and references cited therein). \nBecause the Crown is not required to provide reasons for its refusal, an abuse of process \nclaim on this basis often proves “extraordinarily diffi cult” (para. 32, citing S. Penney, \nV. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada  (3rd ed. 2022), at \n§9.02). Therefore, an accused seeking to preserve their right to a preliminary inquiry \nby electing early  risks locking themselves into tha t decision should the Crown refuse \nto consent to a re -election down the road. The unfairness of this situation, which is to \nthe accused’s detriment, give me great pause about grounding the entitlement to a \npreliminary inquiry on the accused having made a r equest prior to September 19, 2019. \nNor does the 90 -day notice period between when the amendments received royal assent \nand when",

The unfairness of this situation, which is to \nthe accused’s detriment, give me great pause about grounding the entitlement to a \npreliminary inquiry on the accused having made a r equest prior to September 19, 2019. \nNor does the 90 -day notice period between when the amendments received royal assent \nand when they came into effect alleviate these concerns. Without suggesting that, in \nsome cases, ignorance of the law should be an excus e or defence, the reality is that \ndespite efforts by Parliament and the government to publicize the amendments, many \naccused persons may not actually have learned of the change, particularly if they were \nself-represented. Mere knowledge that the law will b e changing is also of little \nassistance to an accused holding off on their election for valid, unrelated reasons. Such \nan accused would remain in the same undesirable position described above of having \nto choose between preserving their entitlement to a pr eliminary inquiry, and making a \nfree and fully informed election as to mode of trial. Finally, the notice provided would \nsimply have communicated that  the law would be  changing  on September 19, 2019. It \nwould not have specifically communicated that the acc used had to  request  a \npreliminary inquiry before that date in order to claim the protections of the old regime.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n \n [143]  The offence date is neither insufficiently concrete nor overly speculative \nas a reference point. The fact that the accused may not ultimately be  charged with the \noffence does not prevent other substantive entitlements from attaching to the offence \ndate. For example, in addition to defences to criminal charges as this Court determined \nin Dineley , the applicable maximum punishment is also determined  with reference to \nthe offence date, subject to the entitlement to the lesser punishment if it has changed \nbetween the date of the offence and sentencing under s. 11(i) of the Charter  (see, e.g., \nR. v. Stuckless , 2019 ONCA 504, 146 O.R. (3d) 752, at para. 93; R. v. Fones , 2012 \nMBCA 110, 288 Man. R. (2d) 86, at para. 60; L.L. v. R. , 2016 QCCA 1367, at \nparas.  134 and 150 (CanLII);  K.R.J. , at para. 25). Furthermore, by the time a court is in \na position to determine whether an accused is eligible for a prelimin ary inquiry, the \naccused has  indeed been  charged — transforming what was once a mere possibility \ninto a concrete reality, with plain consequences for an accused who is deemed \nineligible.  \nC. Summary  \n[144]  Preliminary inquiry eligibility following the 2019 Amendment s should be \ndetermined based on the date of the alleged offence. Where the alleged offence date is \nprior to September 19, 2019, an accused who would have been eligible for a \npreliminary inquiry but for the amendments remains eligible, regardless of the \napplicable maximum punishment. As mentioned above, where the alleged offence date \nis on or after September 19, 2019, the accused must personally be facing a maximum \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n \n punishment of at least 14 years’ imprisonment in order to be eligible for a preliminary \ninquir y under the new regime.  \n[145]  Had Parliament intended this amendment to apply retrospectively, it was \nfree to have said so expressly. Because Parliament chose to remain silent on this \namendment’s temporal application, courts should interpret the amendment based  on the \nrelevant presumptions and their animating purposes. In this case, tying preliminary \ninquiry eligibility to the date of the alleged offence is preferable, both in principle and \nin practice. The rule this Court sets in respect of offences committed p rior to the new \ns. 535 of the Criminal Code will involve a limited number of cases, which will reduce \nwith the passage of time.  \n[146]  As Parliament continues to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction to legislate \namendments to the Criminal Code , it would be well a dvised to clearly articulate the \nintended temporal application of those changes. Absent clear direction, when presented \nwith a range of reasonable options, courts will prefer the one which best protects the \naccused’s substantive rights.  \nIII.",

Disposition  \n[147]  I woul d dismiss the appeal.  \n The reasons of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, O’Bonsawin and Moreau JJ. \nwere delivered by  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n \n  KARAKATSANIS J. —  \nI. Overview  \n[148]  Faced with significant delays in criminal proceedings — threatening the \nright of accused persons to be tried within  a reasonable time, and resulting in stays of \ncriminal charges — Parliament sought to improve the efficiency of the justice system \nby eliminating preliminary inquiries for all but the most serious cases. This appeal \nraises two interpretative questions abou t the amendments. First, to which pre -existing \ncriminal proceedings do they apply? Second, what is the scope of cases in which a \npreliminary inquiry remains available under the new rule?  \n[149]  In 2019, s. 535 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 (“ Cr. C. ”), was \nchanged to restrict the availability of preliminary inquiries to accused persons charged \nwith offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. Before \nthe amendment, there was no condition related  to the maximum penalty for the \noffences.  There is no explicit transitional provision governing the temporal application \nof this amendment. Both immediately before and after the 2019 amendment, a \npreliminary inquiry was only available upon request by either the accused or the \nCrown.  \n[150]  Each r espondent before this Court was accused of one or more historical \nsexual offences against a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before \ncharges were laid, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n \n 10 to 14 years’ impriso nment. Because the penalty for a criminal offence is presumed \nto be that in force when the offence was committed — and because of the guarantee \nunder s. 11(i)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to the lesser punishment \n— they are each liable to  a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment.  \n[151]  The amendment of s. 535 came into effect a few months after the charges \nwere laid and after the respondents first appeared in court. At each of their first \nappearances the respondents reserved their right to elect the ir mode of trial to a later \ndate, meaning their election was postponed to a future appearance. Neither respondent \nrequested a preliminary inquiry until months after the new s. 535 came into force. If \nthe new rule applies to them, they must meet the conditi on that they be charged with \nan offence with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment.  \n[152]  The Crown’s position is that because the requests were not made before \nthe new s. 535 came into force, the new rule applies. As the respondents were not \ncharged with offences for which they could be personally liable to 14 years or more of \nimprisonment, the Crown says a preliminary inquiry was not available under that rule. \nIn separate proceedings, the Court of Québec and the Superior Court agreed and \nconclu ded that Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault had no right to a preliminary inquiry.  \n[153]  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals, remitting the files to the Court \nof Québec for preliminary inquiries. It concluded that the respondents were not subject \nto the new lim itation in s. 535 of the Criminal Code as amended because their \nentitlement to a preliminary inquiry arose on the commission of the alleged offences. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n \n Thus, they were entitled to request a preliminary inquiry under the provision as it read \nat that time, whi ch did not restrict availability to those charged with offences \npunishable by 14 or more years’ imprisonment. The Court of Appeal declined to \nconsider whether they would have had the right to a preliminary inquiry under s. 535 \nas it now reads.  \n[154]  The Crown a ppeals to this Court.

The Court of Appeal declined to \nconsider whether they would have had the right to a preliminary inquiry under s. 535 \nas it now reads.  \n[154]  The Crown a ppeals to this Court. My colleagues would dismiss the appeal. \nThey conclude, for different reasons, that the new rule in s. 535 does not apply to the \nrespondents. My colleague Justice Martin concludes, like the Court of Appeal, that the \nnew rule does not a pply because it came into force after the time of the alleged offences. \nMy colleagues Justices Côté and Rowe conclude that the new rule does not apply \nbecause it came into force after the respondents had been charged with those offences. \nFinally, my collea gue Justice Kasirer concludes that the new rule does not apply \nbecause it came into force after the respondents reserved their right to elect their mode \nof trial at first appearance.  \n[155]  I am unable to agree with any of the positions advanced by my colleagues  \non the issue of temporal application. In my view, the correct interpretation of the new \ns. 535, firmly grounded in the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code , is that it \napplies to accused persons where no request for a preliminary inquiry was made pr ior \nto its coming into force.  \n[156]  Assuming there are no constitutional constraints, the ultimate question \nwhen determining the temporal application of a new rule is whether the legislature \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n \n intended it to apply in the circumstances. Ordinary principles of legi slative \ninterpretation may disclose legislative intent regarding whether the rule applies — for \nexample where there are explicit transitional provisions. Where legislative intent is not \nclear, the jurisprudence has developed presumptions, now codified in t he Interpretation \nAct, R.S.C. 1985, c. I -21, to guide courts in determining how Parliament has balanced \nthe underlying legal values engaged by applying new law to circumstances that existed \nbefore that law’s coming into force.  \n[157]  Here, it is not immediately c lear whether Parliament intended the amended \ns. 535 to apply to the respondents.  Intent must therefore be determined in reference to \nthe presumptions of temporal application. The relevant inquiry in determining the \napplication of s. 535 can be summarized a s follows: new rules are presumed not to \napply where they interfere with a substantive legal interest that has vested before their \ncoming into force.  \n[158]  Limiting access to a preliminary inquiry can interfere with an accused’s \nopportunity to obtain a discharg e, which is a substantive legal interest. Like the right \nto an appeal, and unlike merely evidentiary hearings in the criminal trial process, the \nopportunity to obtain a discharge could put an end to the risk of criminal liability. If \nsuccessful, an accused  person will not face the ordeal of an unjustified criminal trial, \nand may be freed from custody or restrictive conditions pending trial.  These interests \nare not merely relevant to how an accused person conducts their criminal defence — \nthey exist separate ly from that litigation and have a direct, immediate impact on the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n \n accused’s life outside the courtroom. I conclude this substantive legal interest only \nvests once a preliminary inquiry has been requested, given the statutory right is \nexpressly conditioned  on this request. Absent a request, the accused holds no statutory \nright to a preliminary inquiry. Thus, where there has been no request before it came \ninto force, the new limitation can apply without interfering with a vested substantive \nlegal interest.  \n[159]  As to the interpretation of the new limitation in s. 535, a preliminary \ninquiry is available only to “an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that \nis punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment”. In this context, the objective \nseriousness of  the offence is determined by the maximum prison sentence the accused \nactually faces for the offence as charged, not the maximum penalty for an equivalent \noffence were it committed today. This interpretation is grounded in the ordinary \nmeaning of the text,  the broader context and Parliament’s purpose of reducing the \nnumber of preliminary inquiries based on a clear criterion limiting eligibility.  \n[160]  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that a preliminary inquiry is only \navailable to an accused person where e ither: a request was made before the coming into \nforce of the amendment on September 19,",

Background  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n \n [161]  The respondent Agénor Archambault was charged with committing, \nbetween the years 1958 and 1960, the historical crime of indec ent assault against \nanother male person, an indictable offence carrying a maximum term of imprisonment \nof 10 years ( Criminal Code , S.C. 1953 -54, c. 51, s. 148). The crime was repealed in \n1983 ( An Act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to sexual offence s and other \noffences against the person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in \nconsequence thereof , S.C. 1980 -81-82-83, c. 125, s. 8).  \n[162]  The respondent Gilles Grenier was charged with committing, between the \nyears 2003 and 2007, the crime s of sexual interference and sexual assault against a \nperson under 14, both hybrid offences which at the time carried a maximum term of \nimprisonment of 10 years ( Cr. C. , ss. 151 and 271(1)(a) as they read before August 9, \n2012). In 2015, Parliament raised the maximum imprisonment from 10 to 14 years \n(Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act , S.C. 2015, c. 23, ss. 2 and 14).  \n[163]  The respondents first appeared in the Court of Québec in the summer of \n2019. At first appearance, they reserved or postponed their rig ht to elect their mode of \ntrial to a later date, and the matters were adjourned. Regarding Mr. Archambault, he \nagrees with the Crown that he had not yet elected his mode of trial at first appearance \ndespite contrary findings below.  \n[164]  On September 19, 2019, the amendment to s. 535 came into force ( An Act \nto amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to \nmake consequential amendments to other Acts , S.C. 2019, c. 25 (“2019 Amendments”), \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n \n ss. 238 and 406). While both respondents cou ld have elected their mode of trial and \nrequested a preliminary inquiry before that date, they had not yet done so.  \n[165]  In 2020, each respondent requested a preliminary inquiry. In both matters, \nthe Crown argued that the Court of Québec lacked jurisdiction un der s. 535 to hold a \npreliminary inquiry.  \nIII. Decisions Below  \nA. Court of Québec  \n[166]  On February  4, 2020, the Court of Québec (per Rousseau J.C.Q.) held that \nit lacked jurisdiction to preside over Mr. Grenier’s preliminary inquiry. The court \nconcluded that applying the new rule did not impact Mr. Grenier’s substantive rights \nbecause it was procedural. M r. Grenier had no right to a preliminary inquiry under the \nnew rule because the offences with which he was charged were punishable by a \nmaximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. The court concluded the new rule therefore \ndenied Mr. Grenier the right to a prelimin ary inquiry.  \n[167]  On December 21, 2020, the Court of Québec (per Délisle J.C.Q.) dismissed \nMr. Archambault’s request for a preliminary inquiry for similar reasons. The court \nconcluded that preliminary inquiries were of a purely procedural nature, as they could \nalways be set aside should the prosecution decide to move forward by way of a direct \nindictment.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n \n B.

The court \nconcluded that preliminary inquiries were of a purely procedural nature, as they could \nalways be set aside should the prosecution decide to move forward by way of a direct \nindictment.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n \n B. Superior Court of Quebec  \n[168]  Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault  each challenged these decisions, \napplying to the Superior Court for certiorari and mandamus on two gr ounds. They \nargued first they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new rule in s. 535 \ndid not apply to them. They said it would violate the presumption against retrospective \napplication of legislation. Second, even if the new rule applied to them, they argued \nthey nevertheless had the right to a preliminary inquiry, since the offences with which \nthey were charged currently carry a liability of up to 14 years’ imprisonment.  \n[169]  On April 29, 2021, the Superior Court (2021 QCCS 1966, per \nCharbonneau J.) issued reasons for having dismissed Mr. Archambault’s application, \ncharacterizing the right to a preliminary inquiry as purely procedural. Moreover, the \ncourt concluded that the new s. 535 required the accused to be charged with an offence \nfor which th ey could be personally punishable by 14 years’ imprisonment or more. \nThus, it did not apply to Mr. Archambault, given he benefited from the Charter \nprotection under s. 11(i) that brings the maximum punishment for the offences below \n14 years . Section 535 [ TRANSLATION ] “is unambiguous” in that regard (para. 52 \n(CanLII)).  \n[170]  On May 4, 2021, the Superior Court (2021 QCCS 1876, per Thibault J.) \ndismissed Mr. Grenier’s application. As for the temporal application of the amendment \nto s. 535, the court relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. \nR.S., 2019 ONCA 906, and held preliminary inquiries affected an accused’s substantive \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n \n right to a discharge. It concluded, however, that Mr. Grenier’s entitlement had not \nvested by the time the amendment to s. 535 came into force. To get the benefit of the \nold rule, he should have both elected his mode of trial and asked for a preliminary \ninquiry before September 19, 2019, the date the amendment came into force.  \nC. Court of Appeal of Quebec  \n[171]  The Court of Appe al released one set of reasons disposing of both appeals \n(2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174). The court concluded that the new rule in s. 535 \nof the Criminal Code  did not apply to Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault and that they \nwere therefore each entitled t o a preliminary inquiry. It allowed the appeals, finding it \nunnecessary to address whether they would have the right to preliminary inquiries \nunder the new rule.  \n[172]  Writing for a unanimous court, Healy J.A. (Vauclair and Hamilton JJ.A. \nconcurring) interprete d the jurisprudence, including this Court’s decision in R. v. \nDineley , 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, as holding that “the temporal application \nof a legislative amendment does not depend on a formal and categorical distinction \nbetween procedural and sub stantive law but on a functional assessment whether the \namendment affects an acquired right or interest” (para. 26).  \n[173]  In his view, the analysis required “an evaluation of the interests at stake as \na result of the amendment” (para. 26). The greater their sig nificance, the more likely \nan amendment would apply on a prospective basis only. Here, the amendment would \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n \n deprive the accused of the possibility of a discharge and the opportunity for enhanced \ndisclosure under oath. Given these significant interests, the rights at stake were \nacquired from the moment of the commission of the offence and that was the relevant \ndate for determining the entitlement to ask for a preliminary inquiry. The Court of \nAppeal allowed the appeals and remitted each file to the Court of Q uébec for a \npreliminary inquiry.  \nIV. Issues  \n[174",

The Court of \nAppeal allowed the appeals and remitted each file to the Court of Q uébec for a \npreliminary inquiry.  \nIV. Issues  \n[174]  Following the release of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, both respondents \nhad the benefit of a preliminary inquiry. Thus, the Crown’s appeal is moot (A.F., at \npara. 20). The Crown, however, obtained leave and asks th is Court to address the \nimportant issues at stake given conflicting appellate court decisions interpreting s. 535 \nof the Criminal Code (para. 21). This Court has residual discretion to hear a moot \nappeal on the merits ( R. v. Poulin , 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S .C.R. 566, at para. 26; \nBorowski v. Canada (Attorney General) , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342). Given the disagreement \nbetween appellate courts on these issues of national importance and the fact that the \nissues raised have been fully argued by adversarial parties bo th here and in the courts \nbelow, it is in the interests of justice to address the appeal on the merits.  \n[175]  The parties raise two questions of law on this appeal, about the proper \ninterpretation of the amended s. 535 of the Criminal Code : \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n \n 1. Are accused persons subject to the new rule, limiting eligibility for a \npreliminary inquiry, where no request for a preliminary inquiry was \nmade before the coming into force of the new s. 535?  \nI would answer yes. Accused persons are subject to the new limitation if a request  for \na preliminary inquiry was not made before its coming into force.  \n2. Are preliminary inquiries available under the new s. 535 where an \naccused has been charged with an indictable offence for which they are \nnot personally liable to imprisonment for 14 year s or more, even though \nthe offence, if committed today, would carry maximum liability of 14 \nyears’ imprisonment?  \nI would answer no. Under the amended provision, only those who are charged with an \noffence for which they actually face imprisonment of 14 year s or more are entitled to a \npreliminary inquiry on request.  \nV. Analysis  \nA. The History and Availability of Preliminary Inquiries  \n[176]  Preliminary inquiries have been part of the criminal process in Canada \nsince before Confederation (Department of Justice of Canada, W orking Document \nprepared by D. Pomerant and G. Gilmour, A Survey of the Preliminary Inquiry in \nCanada  (April 1993), Annex D, at pp. 19 -20). They trace their roots to procedures of \ncriminal investigation in early English law, in which justices of the peace performed \ninvestigative or prosecutorial functions (pp. 2 -4). Over time, the role of the justice of \nthe peace has evolved considerably to take on judicial characteristics ( Skogman v. The \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n \n Queen , [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93, at pp. 105 -6, citing Law Reform Commission  of Canada, \nStudy Report:  Discovery in Criminal Cases (1974), at p. 8; see also pp. 64 -65).  \n[177]  The preliminary inquiry primarily acts as a procedural safeguard — a \nscreening mechanism to put an end to cases where the evidence is insufficient to order \nthe acc used to stand trial ( R. v. Hynes , 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 30, \nciting Caccamo v. The Queen , [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786; see also Patterson v. The Queen , \n[1970] S.C.R. 409, at p.  412, per Judson J.). Where the threshold is not met ( Cr. C. , s. \n548(1)(a); R. v. Arcuri , 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21 -22), the justice \nmust discharge the accused, ending criminal proceedings regarding that offence ( Cr. \nC., s. 548(",

Arcuri , 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21 -22), the justice \nmust discharge the accused, ending criminal proceedings regarding that offence ( Cr. \nC., s. 548(1)(b); see generally A.  D. Gold and J.  R. Presser, “Let’s Not Do Away with \nthe Preliminaries: A Case in Favour of Retaining the Preliminary Inquiry” (1996), 1 \nCan. Crim. L.R.  145, at pp. 147 -48 and 164) .  \n[178]  As this Court noted in Hynes , “[o]ver  time, the preliminary inquiry has \nassumed an ancillary role as a discovery mechanism” (para. 31). Preliminary inquiries \noffer strategic benefits to the defence. They can be useful to test the evidence and gauge \nthe strength of the Crown’s case and to prov ide testimony on which to test credibility \nat trial (see, e.g., D.  M. Paciocco, “A Voyage of Discovery: Examining the Precarious \nCondition of the Preliminary Inquiry” (2004), 48 Crim. L.Q.  151, at pp. 160 -61; R. v. \nN.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, a t para. 40). The discovery function has, \nhowever, lost some of its significance given the Crown’s constitutional disclosure \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n \n obligations, following this Court’s decision in R. v. Stinchcombe , [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 \n(R. v. S.J.L. , 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 4 26, at para. 23).  \n[179]  It is settled law that there is no constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry \n(S.J.L. , at para. 21). This is because, even without it, the accused keeps the presumption \nof innocence and the right to make full answer and defence ( R. v. Bjelland , 2009 SCC \n38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at para. 32). The Crown must in all cases prove guilt beyond \na reasonable doubt at the eventual trial.  \n[180]  The availability of a preliminary inquiry to an accused is grounded in \nstatute. Before June 2004, the text o f s. 535 of the Criminal Code read:   \n535 Where an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before \na justice, the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into that \ncharge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same tra nsaction, \nfounded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance \nwith this Part.  \n[181]  Over time, questions about the continuing utility and relevance of the \npreliminary inquiry (see generally J.  A. Epp, “Abolishing Preliminary Inquiries in \nCanada” (1996), 38 Crim. L.Q. 495, at pp. 502 -3) resulted in reforms reducing its \navailability. Criminal Code  amendments made the preliminary inquiry available only \non request and allowed for the narrowing of its focus ( Criminal Law Amendment Act, \n2001 , S.C. 2002, c.  13; see also Library of Parliament, Bill C -15A: An Act to amend the \nCriminal Code and to amend other Acts , Legislative Summary LS -410E, October 12, \n2001, at pp. 13 -15). These amendments have generally reduced the number of \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n \n preliminary inquiries  and their length (see S.J.L. , at para. 24). As of  June 2004, s. 535 \nmade clear that the preliminary inquiry would be held only where it has been requested:  \n535 If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a \njustice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry  under \nsubsection 536(4) or 536.1(3), the justice shall, in accordance with this \nPart, inquire into the charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of \nthe same transaction, founded on the facts that",

In R. \nv. Jordan , 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 63 1, this Court specifically encouraged \nParliament to consider “the value of preliminary inquiries in light of expanded \ndisclosure obligations” to ensure the criminal process “focusses on what is truly \nnecessary to a fair trial” (para. 140; see also Standing  Senate Committee on Legal and \nConstitutional Affairs, Delaying Justice is Denying Justice: An Urgent Need to Address \nLengthy Court Delays in Canada  (Final Report)  (2017), at pp. 47 -48).  \n[183]  In that context, Parliament opted to reform preliminary inquiries to  \nimprove the efficiency of criminal proceedings, notably with the desire to “unclog” \ncourt resources, reduce delays, and to avoid the need for witnesses to testify twice \n(House of Commons Debates , vol. 148, No. 300, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 24, 2018, \nat p. 19604).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 125 ---\n \n [184]  Section 535 was changed in 2019 to eliminate preliminary inquiries except \nin the most serious cases. Since then, the availability of preliminary inquiries has been \nsubject to an additional limitation related to the maximum penalty for the releva nt \noffences:  \n535 If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is \npunishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment  is before a justice and a \nrequest has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) \nor 536.1(3), the justice shall , in accordance with this Part, inquire into the \ncharge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, \nfounded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance \nwith this Part.  \n[185]  The amendment to s. 535 came into forc e on September 19, 2019, 90 days \nafter the amending legislation received royal assent ( 2019 Amendments , ss. 238 and \n406). This amendment is the focus of this appeal.  \nB. Determining Whether the New Rule Applies  \n[186]  When Parliament provides no explicit transitional  provisions, determining \nwhether the new rules apply to a particular case can be challenging. The principles \nrelating to the temporal application of legislation are sometimes in tension, and \nrelationships between the presumptions that may apply to a situat ion can be unclear (R. \nSullivan, The Construction of Statutes  (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 724 -25; P. -A. Côté and M. \nDevinat, Interprétation des lois  (5th ed. 2021), at paras. 416 -18; Canada (Attorney \nGeneral) v. Almalki , 2016 FCA 195, [2017] 2 F.C.R. 44, at par as. 26 -28).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n \n [187]  Here, lower courts have come to different solutions as to when the new \nrestrictions apply. The Court of Appeal, citing difficulties in the application of the \npresumptions governing the temporal application of legislation, adopted an open -\ntextu red analysis focused on factors such as the importance of the amendment and the \nimpact on the accused (paras. 26 -31). Applying that analysis, it concluded that the \n“entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is determined with reference to the state of the \nlaw a t the date of the commission of the alleged offence” (para. 11).  \n[188]  Several courts across the country, including all four judges from the Court \nof Québec and Superior Court in this case, have differed from the Court of Appeal in \nhow they characterized the eff ect of the amendments and their temporal application \n(",

Applying that analysis, it concluded that the \n“entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is determined with reference to the state of the \nlaw a t the date of the commission of the alleged offence” (para. 11).  \n[188]  Several courts across the country, including all four judges from the Court \nof Québec and Superior Court in this case, have differed from the Court of Appeal in \nhow they characterized the eff ect of the amendments and their temporal application \n(see, e.g., R.S.; R. v. B.J.M. , 2021 BCPC 151; R. v. Lamoureux , 2019 QCCQ 6616; R. \nv. Kozak , 2019 ONSC 5979, 148 O.R. (3d) 396; R. v. A.S. , 2019 ONCJ 655;  R. v. N.F. , \n2019 ONCJ 656, 383 C.C.C. (3d) 550; R. v. Fraser , 2019 ONCJ 652; R. v. Corneillier , \n2019 QCCQ 6028) . Some courts have concluded that the s. 535 right to a preliminary \ninquiry is of a purely procedural nature such that the new limitation applies \nimmediately in all cases (see, e.g., Lamoureux ). Still others have found that although \nthe amendment is not purely procedural, it only impacts substantive rights where a \npreliminary inquiry had been requested before the rule came into force, such that it \napplies where no request had been made (see, e.g ., R.S.).  \n[189]  As I shall explain, a predictable approach to determining temporal \napplication must clarify and build on the law interpreting the relevant presumptions \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n \n developed in this Court’s jurisprudence and codified by Parliament ( Interpretation Act , \nss. 4 3 and 44). I would clarify and summarize the relationship among the three \npresumptions relevant to the disposition of this appeal in line with the underlying legal \nvalues they engage, not abandon them.  \n(1) Principles Governing the Temporal Application of Legis lation  \n[190]  Questions about the temporal application of legislation concern whether \nnew legislative rules apply to a given circumstance or whether the previous state of the \nlaw continues to apply (Côté and Devinat, at paras.  341-42; see also Sullivan, at p. \n770).  \n[191]  Underlying legal values like fairness and the rule of law may militate \nagainst applying new rules when to do so would negatively affect people who had \nreasonably relied on the previous state of the law in governing their affairs (see \ngenerally Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) , 2017 SCC 50, \n[2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at paras. 44 -45 and 48; R. v. K.R.J. , 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. \n906, at paras. 23 -25; Poulin , at paras. 59 and 62).  \n[192]  Issues of temporal application are sometimes framed in terms of whether a \nparticular legislative amendment is prospective, retroactive, retrospective or of \nimmediate application in the abstract (see, e.g., C.A. reasons, at paras. 11 and 15). \nHowever, this terminology can be confusing and difficult to apply in practice (Sullivan, \nat p. 735; see also Côté and Devinat, at paras.  518-27; Benner v. Canada (Secretary of \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n \n State) , [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 39; Almalki , at paras. 26 -28; J. P. Salembier, \n“Understanding Retroactivity: When the Past Just Ain’t  What It Used to Be” (2003), \n33 Hong Kong L.J.  99, at pp. 99 -100). And it is often insufficient to resolve the actual \nissue before the court. Here the parties agree that the new rule does not apply to all \nimmediately; the disagreement is about the class of  accused persons to whom it applies. \nThe better framing in a case like this is to ask in which circumstances the new rule \napplies.  \n[193]  In the criminal context, some principles of temporal application have \nconstitutional protection ( Charter ,",

Here the parties agree that the new rule does not apply to all \nimmediately; the disagreement is about the class of  accused persons to whom it applies. \nThe better framing in a case like this is to ask in which circumstances the new rule \napplies.  \n[193]  In the criminal context, some principles of temporal application have \nconstitutional protection ( Charter , s. 11(g) and (i); K.R.J. , at paras. 22 -24). Where, as \nhere, constitutional constraints do not arise, the legislature’s intent is paramount (Côté \nand Devinat, at paras. 452 -53 and 457). Did Parliament intend the new rule to apply in \nthe circumstances?  \n[194]  As with any question o f statutory interpretation, determining the temporal \napplication of a new rule must be grounded in the text of the legislation read in its full \ncontext and in harmony with the legislature’s intention ( Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) , \n[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at p ara. 21) . In conducting that analysis, courts “must rely on all \nthe principles of statutory interpretation” ( Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General) , \n2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530 , at para. 36 , citing R. Sullivan,  Sullivan and \nDriedger on the Constructio n of Statutes  (4th ed.  2002), at p. 576). Presumptions of \ntemporal application function as “tool [s]” (Tran , at para. 48)  or “guide [s]” (R. v. Ali, \n[1980] 1 S.C.R. 221 , at p. 235) in this interpretative exercise.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n \n [195]  Where the legislature’s intention as to the  temporal application of specific \nlegislation can be discerned using principles of interpretation other than those \npresumptions of temporal application, courts are bound to give effect to that intention \n(R. v. Clarke , 2014 SCC 28, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 612, at p aras. 10 -11; see also  Ali, at p. \n239).  \n[196]  However, absent transitional provisions and where those principles of \ninterpretation fail to provide a clear answer, the general presumptions governing \ntemporal application become central to the analysis. They have been developed in the \njurisprudence, draw ing on first principles, to guide courts in determining what \nlegislatures must have intended regarding the temporal application of new legislative \nprovisions. These presumptions are themselves expressed in legislation, such as the \nfederal Interpretation Ac t (see, e.g., ss. 43 and 44). Among them are the presumption \nof immediate application of purely procedural law, the presumption against \nretrospectivity, and the presumption against interference with vested rights, discussed \nin further detail below.  \n[197]  Parliam ent of course remains free to depart from the default rules it \nprescribe s (Interpretation Act , s. 3(1)), including by specifying how the  temporal \npresumptions are  to be applied in given circumstances ( see, e.g., Venne v. Quebec \n(Commission de protection du  territoire agricole) , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 880 , at p. 909 ). \nThroughout the analysis, courts must thus be mindful of indicators of Parliament’s \ncontrary intention.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n \n [198]  As I will explain, using these presumptions to determine whether the new \nlimitation in s. 535 applies in a given circumstance requires asking the following \nquestion:  would applying the new rule interfere with a substantive legal interest that \nhas vested before the coming into force of the new rule? If so, the new rule is presumed \nnot to apply in th e circumstances. Otherwise, the new rule is presumed to apply.  \n[199]  To answer that question, we must first look to the definition of a \n“substantive legal interest”; and second, ask whether such an interest has “vested”.

Otherwise, the new rule is presumed to apply.  \n[199]  To answer that question, we must first look to the definition of a \n“substantive legal interest”; and second, ask whether such an interest has “vested”. As \nI shall elaborate below, a substantive  legal interest is a right, privilege, obligation or \nliability that is not merely about how a litigant conducts litigation but has direct \nimplications for the individual outside the courtroom (see R. v. Chouhan , 2021 SCC \n26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136,  at paras. 91-92). Whether the substantive legal interest has \nvested before the coming into force of the new rule depends on whether all factual \nprerequisites to its recognition have occurred (see R. v. Puskas , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, \nat para. 14) .  \n[200]  Prior jurisprudence  may already provide whether a given rule \npresumptively applies. Thus,  where the new rule bears directly on criminal liability \n(i.e., offences, defences and sentence), which is clearly substantive, it is presumed not \nto apply where the alleged criminal off ence was committed before the coming into \nforce of the new rule ( Poulin , at para. 58). Conversely, if jurisprudence establishes that \na new rule is purely procedural (e.g., new judicial investigative hearings as in \nApplication under s. 83.28 of the Criminal  Code (Re) , 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n \n 248), it is presumed to apply immediately in all circumstances ( Chouhan , at paras. 91 -\n92 and 103) .  \n[201]  Otherwise, where the application of the presumptions has not been \nauthoritatively determined, the presumptions must  be directly considered ( Puskas , at \npara. 14). As explained by this Court in Tran and Poulin , the presumptions are rooted \nin the inherent tension between the legal values of fairness and the rule of law.  \n[202]  In the sections that follow, I explain why the ques tion of temporal \napplication before us turns on whether applying the new rule would interfere with a \nsubstantive legal interest that vested before it came into force. First, I consider the three \nrelevant presumptions of temporal application as identified i n the jurisprudence and in \nthe Interpretation Act . I next address the combined effect of these presumptions. \nFinally, I review the distinction between “substantive” as opposed to “procedural” legal \ninterests and provide guidelines to identify when a substa ntive legal interest can be said \nto have “vested”.  \n(a) The Presumptions of Temporal Application  \n[203]  The present case asks this Court to determine the temporal application of \nthe amendment of a Criminal Code  provision. It turns on the interpretation and \ninterrela tionship between three presumptions: (1) the presumption of immediate \napplication of purely procedural legislation; (2) the presumption against retrospective \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n \n application of legislation; and (3) the presumption against interference with vested \nrights.  \n[204]  I turn first to the presumption of immediate application of purely \nprocedural legislation. Where the change in the law is purely procedural, in that \napplying it would not, in any circumstances, affect a substantive legal interest, such as \na substantive right o r liability, the new rule is presumed to apply immediately to all \n(Dineley , at paras. 10 -11; see also Application under s. 83.28 , at para. 56; Wildman v. \nThe Queen , [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 331 -32; Wright v. Hale  (1860), 6 H. & N. 227, \n158 E.R. 94, at p p. 95 -96; Interpretation Act , s. 44(c) and (d)). Whether the legislation \ncould be classified as procedural in the abstract is not determinative. As recognized by \nthis Court in Dineley , all that matters for this presumption is the presence or absence \nof an effect on substantive matters (para. 11; see also Chouhan , at paras. 91 -92; Yew \nBon Tew v. Kenderaan Bas Mara , [1983] 1 A.C. 553 (P.C.), at pp. 562 -",

As recognized by \nthis Court in Dineley , all that matters for this presumption is the presence or absence \nof an effect on substantive matters (para. 11; see also Chouhan , at paras. 91 -92; Yew \nBon Tew v. Kenderaan Bas Mara , [1983] 1 A.C. 553 (P.C.), at pp. 562 -63, cited in \nMartin v. Perrie , [1986] 1 S.C.R. 41, at pp. 48 -49). The corollary of the purely \nprocedural pre sumption is that only effects on substantive legal interests provide \ngrounds to presume a new rule does not apply.  \n[205]  Although the inquiry has sometimes been expressed in terms of substantive \nrights (see, e.g., Dineley , at paras. 10 -11), it also involves othe r substantive legal \ninterests that may not be commonly understood as rights, such as substantive liabilities \nand obligations (Sullivan, at p. 786; R. v. Bourque  (2005), 193 C.C.C. (3d) 485 (Ont. \nC.A.), at para. 11; Yew Bon Tew , at pp. 562-63). Past decisio ns of this Court make it \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n \n clear that the term “right” in this context has a broad meaning and clearly includes, for \nexample, matters touching the accused’s criminal liability, such as available defences \nor sentence ( Chouhan , at para. 92, citing Dineley , at paras. 52 -66, per  Cromwell J., \ndissenting, but not on this point). The term “legal interests” may be more appropriate \nwhen describing this broad category of substantive effects, because as Professors \nPierre -André Côté and Mathieu Devinat have observed, it may be unnatural to speak \nof an accused person having a right  to be tried in accordance with the law as it existed \nat the time of an alleged offence that has since been repealed, for example ( para.  600). \nAs a result, I refer to the more general term substa ntive “legal interests” rather than \nsubstantive “rights”, encompassing the full breadth of this category reflected in this \nCourt’s jurisprudence.  \n[206]  Second, the presumption against retrospectivity means that a change to the \nlaw is presumed not to attach “new prejudicial consequences” to events that occurred \nbefore the change ( Tran , at para. 43, citing E.  A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes  \n(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 186; Sullivan, at p. 750, citing E.  A. Driedger, “Statutes: \nRetroactive Retrospective Reflections” (1978), 56 Can. Bar Rev. 264, at p. 276). \nProfessor Ruth Sullivan notes that while the presumption is “sometimes invoked .  . . in \nan attempt to protect a common law or statute -based right” it is more often invoked \nwhere new prejudicial consequences are attached to “an offence committed before the \nlegislation came into force” (pp. 750 -51; see, e.g., Poulin , at paras. 58 -59; K.R.J. , at \npara. 23). While the presumption is subject to certain exceptions including an exception \nrelated to public protection ( Tran , at paras. 47 and 50, citing Brosseau v. Alberta \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n \n Securities Commission , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 301), they are not relevant here. The \npresumpti on is focused on whether the new rule interferes with the legal consequences \nflowing from events that occurred before the change. If so, the new rule is presumed \nnot to apply.  \n[207]  This Court has said that retrospectivity should not be confused with \nretroactiv ity (Épiciers Unis Métro -Richelieu Inc., division “Éconogros” v. Collin , \n2004 SCC 59, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 257, at para. 46; see also Côté and Devinat, at paras. \n519-20; Sullivan, at pp. 728 -29).

Collin , \n2004 SCC 59, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 257, at para. 46; see also Côté and Devinat, at paras. \n519-20; Sullivan, at pp. 728 -29). In broad strokes, the retroactive application of law \ndoes not mer ely attach new consequences to past facts (as is the case with retrospective \napplication), but rather deems the law applicable to those facts to have been different \nfrom what it actually was (Sullivan, at pp. 737 -38; Driedger (1978), at pp. 268 -69; \nBenner , at para. 39). Here, the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code  does not deem the law \nto have been different than it was in the past and the parties did not argue that it does.  \n[208]  Third, there is the presumption against interference with vested rights. This \npresump tion has a different focus than the presumption against retrospectivity but can \nbe similar in effect. Legislation is presumed not to interfere with rights held by \nindividuals that were “tangible, concrete and distinctive” before it came into force \n(Dikrani an, at paras. 32 -34 and 39). These rights may arise in private law, such as rights \nin property, contractual rights or rights to damages, or may be statutory creations, such \nas certain substantive rights in the litigation process (Sullivan, at pp. 760 and 7 62). The \nthreshold of “tangible, concrete and distinctive” has two primary facets: (1) the right \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n \n must be that of a particular individual rather than belonging to a community or general \nclass; and (2) the right must be sufficiently constituted before the co ming into force of \nthe legislative change, in that it exists and is possessed by individuals at the relevant \ntime ( Dikranian , at paras. 37 and 39). If a new rule would interfere with a right with \nthese features, such that it has “vested”, it is presumed no t to apply.  \n[209]  These presumptions of temporal application and others have been in part \ncodified by Parliament in the Interpretation Act , which provides:  \n3 (1) Every provision of this Act applies, unless a contrary intention \nappears, to every enactment, wheth er enacted before or after the \ncommencement of this Act.  \n \n. . . \n \n43 Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not  \n \n. . . \n \n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, \naccruing or incurred under the e nactment so repealed,  \n \n(d) affect any offence committed against or contravention of the \nprovisions of the enactment so repealed, or any punishment, penalty or \nforfeiture incurred under the enactment so repealed, or  \n \n(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any \nright, privilege, obligation or liability referred to in paragraph (c) or in \nrespect of any punishment, penalty or forfeiture referred to in paragraph \n(d),  \n \nand an investigation, lega l proceeding or remedy as described in paragraph \n(e) may be instituted, continued or enforced, and the punishment, penalty \nor forfeiture may be imposed as if the enactment had not been so repealed.  \n \n \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n \n 44 Where an enactment, in this section called the “forme r enactment”, is \nrepealed and another enactment, in this section called the “new enactment”, \nis substituted therefor,  \n \n. . . \n \n(c) every  proceeding taken under the former enactment shall be taken \nup and continued under and in conformity with the new enactment in so \nfar as it may be done consistently with the new enactment;  \n \n(d) the procedure established by the new enactment shall be follow ed as \nfar as it can be adapted thereto  \n \n(i) in the recovery or enforcement of fines, penalties and \nforfeitures imposed under the former enactment,  \n \n(ii) in the enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the \nformer enactment, and  \n \n(iii) in a proceedi ng in relation to matters that have happened \nbefore the repeal;  \n(b) The Combined Effect of the Presumptions  \n[210]  How are we to understand the relationship among these three relevant \npresumptions such that we can apply them together in a principled way?

The inquiry \nstarts by asking whether the new rule is purely procedural, since, in the affirmative, it \nis unnecessary to consider the other temporal presumptions. This is because, as I have \nsaid, where it is shown that a new rule is purely procedural, it applies immedi ately in \nall circumstances. The longstanding principle that there can be no vested rights in \nprocedure (see Wright , at pp.  95-96; Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co. , [1988] 2 \nS.C.R. 256 , at pp. 265 -66; Wildman , at p. 331; Application under s. 83.28 , at pa ra. 62; \nChouhan , at para. 99) means there is no need to ask about vesting where only procedure \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n \n is affected. Where, however, the new rule is not purely procedural, the analysis must \ncontinue to consider the other presumptions.  \n[211]  Some argue before us, to the c ontrary, that a finding that an amendment is \nnot purely procedural ends the analysis and renders recourse to other presumptions of \ntemporal application unnecessary. According to this theory, as soon as substantive \nrights are “engaged”, the new rule presump tively does not apply to any accused alleged \nto have committed an offence before the change in the law (I.F. ( Canadian Civil \nLiberties Association (“CCLA”) ), at para. 30; see also R.F. (Archambault), at para. 41). \nThe CCLA, in particular, relies on the sta tement in Dineley , at para. 10, that “where \nlegislative provisions affect either vested or substantive rights, retrospectivity has been \nfound to be undesirable”. This statement means, the CCLA says, that if an amendment \naffects a substantive right, the ame ndment does not apply to any accused whether or \nnot the right has vested (I.F., at para. 23).  \n[212]  I do not accept this interpretation of Dineley . There is no indication that \nthis Court in Dineley intended “vested or substantive rights” to suggest the existence  \nof two distinct types of rights for the purpose of the temporal presumptions, as opposed \nto offering two adjectives to describe the same class of rights (para. 10). None of the \nreferences cited in Dineley  (Angus , at pp. 266 -67; Application under s. 83.28 , at \npara.  57; Wildman , at pp. 331 -32) appear to apply that bifurcation. Further, while this \nCourt relied on Dineley  more recently in Chouhan , there is nothing in the reasons of \nMoldaver and Brown JJ. on this issue that purports to apply “substantive” and “ vested” \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n \n rights as disjunctive ideas (see paras. 91 -92 and 96). That language from Dineley  is \nabsent from their restatement of the relevant principles (paras. 91 -92) and at para. 96 \nthey wrote that “even where a procedure operates more favourably to the acc used than \nits replacement, there is no vested interest, and by extension, no substantive right to a \nspecific procedure”, expressly equating them. This Court in Dineley did not have to \nconsider vesting in any detail given, in that case, the amendment at issue was found to \naffect a criminal defence and only came into force midway through trial.  \n[213]  How then do the other two presumptions described above apply where the \nnew rul e is not purely procedural? The relationship between the presumptions against \nretrospectivity (against a change in the law attaching new prejudicial consequences to \nevents that occurred before the change) and against interference with vested rights \n(agains t legislation interfering with an individual’s rights that were vested before it \ncame into force) can be vexing, because while they are framed to focus on different \nelements of temporal application, they can be understood as overlapping, or as \n“different s ides of the",

The relationship between the presumptions against \nretrospectivity (against a change in the law attaching new prejudicial consequences to \nevents that occurred before the change) and against interference with vested rights \n(agains t legislation interfering with an individual’s rights that were vested before it \ncame into force) can be vexing, because while they are framed to focus on different \nelements of temporal application, they can be understood as overlapping, or as \n“different s ides of the same coin” (Sullivan, at p. 770). They are both invoked in \ncircumstances, as here, where parties seek to protect rights (p. 750). As Ruth Sullivan \nexplains, “[i]nterference with a vested right is always retrospective in that rights arise \nby vir tue of facts that fulfil the conditions precedent to the right and subsequently \nimpairing them changes the legal consequences of those facts in a prejudicial way” (pp. \n750-51, fn. 91). The two presumptions both target legislation that “change[s] the future  \nlegal consequences of past facts” (p. 770). It is unsurprising that this Court referenced \nthe presumptions in the same breath in Dineley (at para. 10) and that other courts have \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n \n done the same (see, e.g., Bell Canada v. Amtelecom Limited Partnership , 2015 FCA \n126, [2016] 1 F.C.R. 29, at paras. 34 -35). \n[214]  This overlap is consistent with the codification of  the vested rights \npresumption in the Interpretation Act , which makes clear that repeal does not affect \n“any right, privilege, obligation or liability ” arising under the repealed legislation (s. \n43(c); see also Sullivan, at p. 761). In all these cases, whether conceived as the \npresumption against retrospectivity or the presumption against interference with vested \nrights, the presumption prevents changes  to legal interests that have arisen because of \npast facts. The presumption against retrospectivity says that if the new rule attaches \nnew prejudicial consequences to those facts, for example because it eliminates a right \nthat those facts gave rise to unde r the previous state of the law, it is presumed not to \napply. The presumption against interference with vested rights and the remainder of s. \n43(c) of the Interpretation Act  say that the new rule will also be presumed not to apply \nif applying it would affe ct any pre -existing right, privilege, obligation or liability (i.e., \nlegal interest), for example by eliminating a pre -existing right.  \n[215]  The combined effect of these presumptions, therefore, is to look at the facts \nthat had occurred before the new rule came  into force and decide whether they establish \na legal interest that the law is presumed to protect. If so, the new rule will be presumed \nnot to apply where it would interfere with that interest.  \n[216]  Our jurisprudence refers to a legal interest as “vested” whe n all the facts, \nor in the language of Puskas “conditions precedent” (para. 14), have occurred for the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n \n law to recognize it. Where the legal interest has vested before a new rule came into \nforce, the new rule is presumed not to apply if it would interfere w ith that legal interest. \nAnd because the purely procedural presumption provides that only substantive legal \ninterests can raise a presumption of non -application — there is no vested substantive \nlegal interest in procedure — these legal interests must neces sarily be substantive.  \n[217]  Thus, in applying these three presumptions, the key question is whether the \nnew rule would interfere with a substantive legal interest that had vested before its \ncoming into force.  \n[218]  Answering that question requires understanding whe n a legal interest is \n“substantive” and when it has “vested”. These two thresholds are the heart of the \npresumptions relevant to the disposition of this appeal. Both concepts are thresholds \nseeking to balance the underlying legal values of fairness and the  rule of law (see, e.g., \nTran , at paras. 44 -45; Poulin , at para. 62).  \n(c) The Substantive Threshold  \n[219]  It has sometimes proven difficult for courts to identify whether a new rule \ncan interfere with a substantive legal interest or whether it is purely procedural ( Côté \nand Devinat, at para. 707 , citing Dineley ).

Reconciling all past precedents may be an \n“impossible task” ( Dineley , at para. 15).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n \n [220]  The balance of fairness and the rule of law in the presumption of immediate \napplication of purely procedural legislation i s reflected in the “substantive” threshold, \nwhich starts from the premise that interference with existing legal interests and other \nunjust results of applying new legislation should be avoided (Sullivan, at p. 786). \nHowever, if those legal interests are to  be protected, it is necessary to have effective \nprocedural rules that allow them to be vindicated in court. Giving procedural reform \nimmediate effect ensures that courts do not continue to carry out procedures that the \nlegislature has decided are less tha n ideal for that purpose (see Côté and Devinat, at \npara. 690; see also P. Roubier, Le droit transitoire: conflits des lois dans le temps  (2nd \ned. 1993), at p. 548; D. Bailey and L. Norbury, Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on \nStatutory Interpretation  (8th ed. 2 020), at pp. 271 -72). In this way, applying new \nprocedural rules immediately to all is “deemed beneficial for all” and protects, rather \nthan interferes with, settled expectations ( Application under s. 83.28 , at para. 62). As a \nlegal interest becomes less a  means to establish other rights and liabilities through \nlitigation and more as an end in itself independent of that litigation, it becomes more \nlikely that the legal interest will meet the “substantive” threshold (see Chouhan , at para. \n92, per Moldaver an d Brown JJ.).  \n[221]  The appropriate balance as reflected in the “substantive” threshold should \nbe guided by the case law on temporal application, which shows how it is achieved in \nparticular contexts. The jurisprudence reveals at least three broad categories of  \nrecognized interference with substantive legal interests in the criminal litigation \ncontext. In the first category are those effects that can be said to bear directly on \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n \n criminal liability, specifically the penal consequences the law will attach to impugn ed \nconduct (see, e.g., Poulin , at paras. 58 -59). This group includes material changes to the \nelements of the offence, applicable defences and sentences, which could leave the \naccused facing different consequences for the impugned conduct at the close of \nlitigation ( Chouhan , at para. 92; see, e.g., Dineley ). The second category are effects on \nthe jurisdiction of courts to hear matters and related appeals (Sullivan, at pp. 788 -89; \nPuskas , at paras. 6 -7). Changes to the availability of these hearings could als o \nultimately leave the accused facing different consequences. For example, an accused \nerroneously convicted at trial may be in a very different position in terms of their \ncriminal record and liberty interest depending on whether they have a right of appeal . \nThe third category includes effects to constitutional protections that attach to the \ncriminal process, given these rights are “necessarily substantive” ( Dineley , at para. 21).  \n[222]  In determining whether a new rule can interfere with a substantive legal \ninterest, courts should be mindful that substantive law “creates rights and obligations \nand is concerned with the ends which the administration of justice seeks to attain, \nwhereas procedural law is the vehicle providing the means and instruments by which \nthose ends are attained” ( Sutt v. Sutt , [1969] 1 O.R. 169 (C.A.), at p. 175, cited in \nChouhan , at para. 94). As noted in Chouhan , procedural amendments will generally \n“alter the method  by which a litigant conducts an action or establishes a defence or \nasserts a right” (para. 92 (emphasis added)).

They remain, however, “necessarily substantive” ( Dineley , \nat para. 21), because their protection is not merely instrumental but an end our law \nseeks to guarantee.  \n[223]  In addition, where a potentially relevant substantive legal interest has been \nidentified, the new rule must “affect [its] content  or existence ” to establish an  \ninterference with that interest for the purpose of the temporal presumptions; a mere \nimpact on “the manner  of its enforcement or use” does not amount to interference \nunless it renders enforcement or use practically impossible ( Angus , at pp. 265 -66 \n(emphas is in original); see also Dineley , at paras. 15 -16; Côté and Devinat, at para. \n707).  \n(d) The Vesting Threshold  \n[224]  The presumptions against retrospectivity and against the interference with \nvested rights can also be understood in light of the underlying legal val ues, namely \nfairness and the rule of law, which the “vesting” threshold seeks to hold in balance (see \ngenerally Côté and Devinat, at paras. 615 -16). On the one hand, the law acknowledges \nthat people have the right to proceed in reliance on their substantiv e legal interests such \nthat it could be unfair to abruptly change these interests by legislation (Sullivan, at p. \n761, citing Upper Canada College v. Smith  (1920), 61 S.C.R. 413, at p. 417). Setting \nthe threshold too high could undermine public confidence in the law’s stability \nnecessary to uphold the rule of law. But the legislature must have the flexibility to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n \n change the law to achieve evolving public policy goals. Setting the threshold too low \ncould frustrate the democratic evolution of the law ( Gustavso n Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. \nMinister of National Revenue , [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271, at pp. 282 -83). As the affected \nsubstantive legal interest becomes one on which people are likely to place greater \nreasonable reliance in conducting their affairs, the less likely  it is that the new rule \nshould apply.  \n[225]  Many different words have been used in our jurisprudence and in the \nInterpretation Act  to capture the idea that legal interests must be sufficiently constituted \nto benefit from a presumptive protection against interf erence (“acquired”, e.g. \nInterpretation Act , s. 43(c); “accrued”, e.g. Interpretation Act , s. 43(c), Gustavson \nDrilling , at p. 284, and Dikranian , at para. 39; “vested”, e.g. Gustavson Drilling , at p. \n282; “crystallize[d]”, e.g. Benner , at para. 51, and Dikranian , at paras. 30 and 43; \n“materialized”, e.g. Dikranian , at para. 40; “tangible and concrete”, e.g. Dikranian , at \npara. 37). Thus, “vesting”, as the term is used here, must be understood to capture the \nfull breadth of these circumstances.  \n[226]  For some le gal interests the jurisprudence will provide clear answers about \nwhen it has vested. For example, it is clear from the authorities that criminal liability, \nthat is the substantive law governing elements of the offence, corresponding defences \nand applicable  sentence, vests at the time of the commission of the alleged offence \n(Poulin , at paras. 58 -59; R. v.

The accused’s \ncriminal liability is determined under the law prevailing at the time of the alleged \noffence and law coming into force after that date is presumed not to interfere with the \nliability so incurred.  \n[227]  As compared with criminal liability, determining when vesting occurs will \nbe more difficult when dealing with unique statutory rights created to achieve specific \nlegislative goals. As Professor Sullivan has observed, the methods of enfor cing such \nrights and claims “follow no fixed pattern” (p. 762). The legislature has the freedom to \ncraft the features of such a right, including when it can be considered to have vested. A \ncourt’s task is to identify the conditions precedent to vesting bas ed on the unique right \nthe legislature has created, which requires careful attention to the statutory context and \nto the purposes of the threshold described above.  \n[228]  The facts that must occur for a statutory legal interest to vest therefore \ndepend on its uni que nature ( Dikranian , at para. 40). In the tax context, for example, it \nis “imperative that legislation conform to changing social needs and governmental \npolicy. A taxpayer may plan his financial affairs in reliance on the tax laws remaining \nthe same; he takes the risk that the legislation may be changed” ( Gustavson Drilling , \nat pp. 282 -83). In contrast, in the immigration law context, it is imperative that \npermanent residents be able to organize their lives, such that clear “obligations must be \ncommunicated to them in advance” ( Tran , at para. 41). In examining when a legal \ninterest vests under the Criminal Code , courts should thus be mindful of the delicate \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n \n balancing exercise underlying the threshold in light of the specific context in which the \nstatutory right arises.  \n[229]  That said, it will be difficult to say a legal interest is vested where it remains \ncontingent on an intervening action or event. For example, when the creation of the \nlegal interest requires a third party to exercise discretion in a  particular way, and that \ndiscretion could lawfully be exercised differently, the threshold is unlikely to be met \n(Sullivan, at pp. 766 -67; see, e.g., Tuffnail v. Meekes , 2020 ONCA 340, 449 D.L.R. \n(4th) 478, at para. 104). In other words, the favourable ex ercise of that discretion by \nthe third party is likely to be considered a condition precedent for the legal interest to \nvest. Likewise, if people had the ability to take the action necessary to acquire a certain \nbenefit but failed to do so before the comin g into force, it is more difficult to conclude \nthat any reliance placed on that unrealized possibility deserves to be protected (see, \ne.g., Attorney General of Quebec v. Expropriation Tribunal , [1986] 1 S.C.R. 732, at \npp. 742 -43; Abbott v. Minister for Lan ds, [1895] A.C. 425 (P.C.), at pp. 430 -31). \nAlternatively, where actions are not required to obtain the interest under the law but are \nonly mere formalities in exercising it, they are unlikely to be preconditions to the \nvesting of that interest (see, e.g.,  Re Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. v. Minister of \nRevenue for Ontario  (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.), at p. 250).  \n(e) Conclusion on the Applicable Principles  \n[230]  The presumptions governing temporal application are tools used to \ndetermine the legislature’s intent.

There may be other bases on which courts will \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n \n decline to apply a new rule, in accordance with other principles of interpretation. But \nwhere other principles fail to provide a clear answer regarding the temporal application \nof a new rule, the presumptions become central to the analysis.  \n[231]  The three presumptions at issue all direct careful focus on the effects to an \nindividual’s legal interests of applying the new rule. Together, they provide that the \nnew rule will presumptively apply unless it interferes wit h a substantive legal interest \nthat had vested before it came into force. This inquiry can be understood in two stages.  \n[232]  First, if the new rule is purely procedural, in that applying it could not \ninterfere with any substantive legal interest, it is presume d to apply immediately in all \ncircumstances. Whether a legal interest is substantive is guided by categories settled in \nthe jurisprudence, and the underlying legal values of fairness and the rule of law rather \nthan the abstract procedural nature of the leg islation itself.  \n[233]  Second, if the new rule can interfere with a substantive legal interest, the \nnext question is whether applying it in the circumstances would affect a substantive \nlegal interest that vested before it came into force. A legal interest vests  once all the \nfacts necessary to recognize its existence have occurred. While those facts may \ngenerally be settled for recurring categories such as criminal liability, in cases involving \nunique statutory rights, careful attention must be paid to the nature  of the right as \nexpressed in the statute in light of how the legislature has balanced the reasonable \nexpectations of interest holders against the democratic evolution of the law.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n \n (2) The Temporal Application of Section 535  \n[234]  To answer the question of which accused are subject to  the new limitation \non the right to a preliminary inquiry in s. 535 (that the offence charged be punishable \nby 14 years or more imprisonment) , the parties have proposed three possibilities. First, \nthe Crown’s position is that the new rule applies immediately, unless a preliminary \ninquiry was in progress or a request to hold one had been made before it came into \nforce (A.F., at para. 77). It argues that preliminary inquiries are not part of the \nsubstantive law that is presumptively dete rmined by the law in force at the time of the \ncommission of the alleged offence (paras. 49 -62). In the Crown’s view, changes to the \navailability of preliminary inquiries should not be put on the same footing as the \nchanges to the elements of an offence or contemporaneous defences (paras. 64 -65).  \n[235]  Second, the respondents answer that because it is substantive, the right to \na preliminary inquiry arose at the time of the alleged commission of the offence (R.F. \n(Archambault), at para. 41; R.F. (Grenier), at para . 1). Courts are and should be \nreluctant to apply penal provisions retrospectively. Under the principle of legality, \naccording to the respondents, substantive law includes not only the elements of the \noffence, any relevant defences and the maximum sentence , but also incidental \nprocedures like the preliminary inquiry. The new limitation therefore only applies to \naccused persons whose offences were allegedly committed after its coming into force.  \n[236]  And third, the respondents submit in the alternative that the new limitation \nonly applies to accused who had not yet had their first appearance. They submit that \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n \n the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry vested at first appearance, because accused \npersons then have their first possibility to make a request (R.F. (Arch ambault), at para. \n45; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 3). Because there was no impediment to their election as to \nthe mode of trial, and depending on their election, to ask for a preliminary inquiry, their \nstatutory right to a preliminary inquiry was vested (R.F .

Because there was no impediment to their election as to \nthe mode of trial, and depending on their election, to ask for a preliminary inquiry, their \nstatutory right to a preliminary inquiry was vested (R.F . (Archambault), at paras. 48 \nand 54 -65; transcript, at pp. 91 -96). On the facts of this case, the respondents had \nspecifically reserved or deferred their election and request before the coming into force \nof the new limitation (R.F. (Archambault), at para.  46). \n[237]  Looking first to the legislation, there are no explicit transitional provisions \nthat apply to s. 535. While Parliament’s general purpose of eliminating delay in the \ncriminal justice system is well understood (see, e.g., House of Commons Debates , at \npp. 19602 -4), courts must be careful not to equate the purpose of the new rule with \nParliament’s specific intention as to temporal application. Regardless of the conclusion \nas to the class of accused to which it applies, the amendment here would still limit  the \navailability of preliminary inquiries, thus serving Parliament’s  general purpose.  \n[238]  The delayed coming into force of the amendment by 90 days can, like the \nrest of the statutory context, be a relevant factor to consider in the broader analysis \n(Sulliva n, at p. 775; Newton v. Crouch , 2016 BCCA 115, 384 B.C.A.C. 164, at para. \n78). Here, it may be an indication that Parliament intended to provide notice to people \nthat could immediately be impacted by the new rule (i.e., accused persons already in \nthe crimi nal justice system). However, a delay in coming into force is not on its own \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n \n determinative of legislative intent ( Ali, at pp. 242 -43), and it is insufficient here to give \na definitive answer as to the circumstances in which Parliament meant the new rule to  \napply.  \n[239]  The Crown notes that the sponsoring Minister’s department later stated that \nthe amendment applied to those who had not asked for a preliminary inquiry by the \ntime of coming into force (Department of Justice, Legislative Background: An Act to \namend  the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make \nconsequential amendments to other Acts, as enacted (Bill C -75 in the 42nd Parliament)  \n(2019), at p. 24, fn. 68; A.F., at para. 90 ). This Court cannot, though, put undue weight \non these statements made outside of Parliament after enactment, since it is intent of the \nenacting Parliament that determines the proper interpretation (see Professional Institute \nof the Public Service of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2012 SCC 71, [20 12] \n3 S.C.R. 660, at para. 98).  \n[240]  As there is no clear basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliament’s \nspecific intention regarding the temporal application of the new s. 535, the temporal \napplication therefore falls to be determined using the tempor al presumptions, in line \nwith the framework set out above.  \n(a) Can the Limitation on the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry Impact a \nSubstantive Legal Interest?  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n \n [241]  One of the effects of denying accused persons a preliminary inquiry is the \nloss of the benefits derived  from its discovery function, including the opportunity to \ncross -examine witnesses before trial, and to test the strength of the case. Even though \nthe discovery function of preliminary inquiries has lost some of its significance over \ntime, in practice, the  discovery function still offers important strategic value to accused \npersons (see, e.g., N.S., at para. 40; R. v. Rao , 2012 BCCA 275, 323 B.C.A.C. 165, at \npara. 95). For many accused, that may be its “real worth” (Paciocco, at p. 160; see also \nK. Roach, “ Preserving Preliminary Inquiries” (1999), 42 Crim. L.Q.  161, at p. 162). \nThe preliminary inquiry “enables the defence to flesh out a Crown witness’s story and \ncommit the witness to a specific and detailed account. If a witness’s testimony at",

L.Q.  161, at p. 162). \nThe preliminary inquiry “enables the defence to flesh out a Crown witness’s story and \ncommit the witness to a specific and detailed account. If a witness’s testimony at trial \nconflicts with his or her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, such inconsistencies will \nprovide a basis for impeachment” (S. Penney, V.  Rondinelli and J.  Stribopoulos, \nCriminal Procedure in Canada  (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶9.126; see also M. Vauclair, T. \nDesjardins and P. Lachance, Trait é général de preuve et de procédure pénales 2024  \n(31st ed. 2024), at pp. 579 -80). \n[242]  An accused has a constitutional right to disclosure under Stinchcombe (R. \nv. Gubbins , 2018 SCC 44, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 35, at para. 18), and constitutional \nprotections in the criminal process are “necessarily subst antive” ( Dineley , at para. 21). \nHowever, the removal of the preliminary inquiry does not interfere with this \nconstitutional right. Whether a change is said to be strategically important to the \naccused does not, on its own, establish that it interferes with  a substantive legal interest \n(Chouhan , at paras. 96 -98, per Moldaver and Brown JJ.). Here, the Crown’s duty to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 152 ---\n \n disclose does not extend to making witnesses available for examination ( R. v. Khela , \n[1995] 4 S.C.R. 201, at para. 18). The Crown must meet its duty regarding disclosure \ndespite the availability of the preliminary inquiry. Thus, losing an additional discovery \nfunction cannot interfere with the constitutional right to disclosure.  \n[243]  Moreover, although proceeding without a preliminary inquiry may affe ct \nhow an accused conducts  their defence, for example by losing the possibility of cross -\nexamining to establish an evidentiary basis for trial (see R. v. George (1991),  5 O.R. \n(3d) 144 (C.A.), at pp. 144 -45), changing a purely evidentiary hearing will gene rally \nbe relevant only to the means  (or method) by which the related litigation is resolved. \nCross -examining witnesses at a preliminary inquiry is simply “not a component of the \nright to make full answer and defence” ( Bjelland , at para. 32). Changes to hea rings in \nthe criminal context for the purpose of gathering evidence or information have been \nunderstood as purely procedural (see, e.g., Application under s. 83.28 , at para. 61).  \n[244]  Still, I agree with Doherty J.A. in R.S. that the rule limiting the right to a \npreliminary inquiry can interfere with a substantive legal interest when its effect is to \neliminate the opportunity for accused persons to be discharged at the close of the \ninquiry (para. 49). Where the Crown cannot meet its low evidentiary burden for an  \naccused to be ordered to stand trial, the accused must be discharged following the \npreliminary inquiry ( Cr. C. , s. 548(1)(b)). In my view, the opportunity available at a \npreliminary inquiry to be “spare[d] .  . . the ordeal of an unjustified criminal trial ” \n(Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at ¶9.131)  is a substantive legal interest. As \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n \n noted by our Court in Skogman , the screening function of the preliminary inquiry “ is \nto protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public tri al \nwhere the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the \ncontinuation of the process” (p. 105).  \n[245]  This opportunity to be discharged at the preliminary inquiry may also be \nan opportunity for the accused to remove limits on their liberty , where the accused is \nremanded to custody or subject to restrictive terms pending trial.

When there is no \npreliminary inquiry, the accused may remain subject to these restrictions on liberty \nuntil the proceedings are concluded (Gold and Presser, at pp. 14 7-48 and 164; C. M. \nWebster and H. H. Bebbington, “Why Re -open the Debate on the Preliminary Inquiry? \nSome Preliminary Empirical Observations” (2013), 55 C.J.C.C.J.  513, at p. 521; see \nalso R.S., at paras. 57 -58). These effects cannot be understood only in  the litigation; \nthey do not merely change how the accused advances their defence. The opportunity to \navoid the stigma and personal stress related to an unresolved criminal charge, to avoid \na needless trial where evidence is insufficient, and to be free of  any restrictions on \nliberty, exists apart from the methods or means of conducting the litigation. This \nopportunity is thus a substantive legal interest that can be interfered with should the \navailability of a preliminary inquiry be removed.  \n[246]  The right to a  preliminary inquiry is analogous in this way to the right to \nhave an appeal heard, which is a substantive right (Côté and Devinat, at para. 718 , \nciting Puskas ). Like the right to an appeal, the right to a preliminary inquiry entitles the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n \n holder to a furth er opportunity to challenge or mitigate their criminal liability. Although \nthey arise at different times in the proceedings (one before trial and the other after \njudgment), both may end in a disposition that bears on the accused’s (or appellant’s) \ncircumst ances outside the courtroom. They are in this way distinct from hearings that \nare merely evidentiary and do not culminate in this kind of determination (see, e.g., \nApplication under s. 83.28 ).  \n[247]  In sum, adding this new limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry can \ninterfere with a substantive legal interest. It can affect the very existence of the \nopportunity to obtain a discharge. It is not purely procedural and does not attract \nimmediate application in every circumstance. To determine wheth er or not the new rule \nis presumed to apply in a given circumstance, we must ask whether applying it in that \ncircumstance would interfere with a substantive legal interest that had vested before its \ncoming into force.  \n(b) When Does the Right to a Preliminary I nquiry Vest?  \n[248]  Here, the parties disagree as to which preconditions are essential for the \nright to a preliminary inquiry to have vested. As this is a statutory right that has never \nbeen considered by this Court, we must determine the necessary preconditions by \nlooking to the statutory construction of the right, understood in light of the underlying \nvalues of fairness and the rule of law that govern this area of the law. In line with the \nsubmissions of the parties, I examine three key points in the criminal pr ocess: first, the \ntime of the commission of the alleged offence; second, the point in the proceedings at \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 155 ---\n \n which there are no further conditions outside the control of the accused to ask for a \npreliminary inquiry; and third, when the request is made. As I sh all explain, I conclude \nthat requesting a preliminary inquiry is a necessary precondition to exercising the right, \nsuch that the right only vests at that third point.  \n[249]  First, the right to a preliminary inquiry does not vest when the offence is \nalleged to ha ve been committed. While the removal of the right to a preliminary inquiry \ninterferes with a substantive legal interest, it does not follow that the opportunity to be \ndischarged at a preliminary inquiry forms part of the “substantive law” about criminal \nliability that is understood to vest at the time of the commission of the offence. \nRespectfully, the Court of Appeal erred to the extent it held otherwise (para. 17). It is \nclear from our jurisprudence that not all substantive legal interests will vest at th e time \nof the commission of the offence. For example, the right to an appeal, while \nsubstantive, is",

It is \nclear from our jurisprudence that not all substantive legal interests will vest at th e time \nof the commission of the offence. For example, the right to an appeal, while \nsubstantive, is determined in reference to the date when the judgment below is issued, \nnot the date the underlying offence was committed (see Puskas , at para. 14; see also \nTcheng v. Coopérative d’habitation Chung Hua , 2016 QCCA 461, at paras. 36 -38 and \n59-60). The elements of the offence establishing guilt, the existence of a defence and \nthe applicable sentence all determine the criminal liability the law attaches, if any, t o \nthe impugned conduct. The availability of an appeal or a preliminary inquiry have no \nsuch impact and do not fall within the “substantive law” described in Poulin . \n[250]  In Poulin , our Court  explained that the substantive law which directly \ngoverns criminal lia bility is generally determined as of the commission of the offence \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n \n (paras. 58 -59; see also Tran , at paras. 43 -45). The reasoning outlined in that case is the \nprinciple of legality — the idea that we ought to protect a person’s reliance on the state \nof the law when they were deciding how to conduct themselves and whether to “risk \nthe liability” associated with breaking the law ( Poulin , at para. 59; see also Reference \nre ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code , at p. 1152). As I have said, the \npreliminar y inquiry, like an appeal, does not directly affect the criminal liability the \nlaw attaches to impugned conduct. Conduct is not made legal or illegal, nor made \nsubject to greater or lesser penal consequence because it could be examined at a \npreliminary inq uiry or on appeal. Thus, it does not implicate the principle of legality in \nthe same way as a change to the substantive law defining whether that conduct is \nsubject to the consequences of criminal liability. It strains credulity to imagine that \npeople weig h the availability of a preliminary inquiry, or of an appeal, in determining \nhow to conduct themselves and whether to risk criminal liability. At the time of the \ncommission of the offence, no expectation is created with which it would be unfair to \ninterfer e.  \n[251]  The availability and exercise of the right ultimately depends on significant \ncontingencies standing between the commission of the offence and the holding of a \npreliminary inquiry, including whether a charge will actually be laid and, in the case of \na hybrid offence, whether prosecutorial discretion will be exercised to proceed \nsummarily. The existence of these discretionary steps before a preliminary inquiry \ncould ever be available is fundamentally incompatible with a vested legal interest \n(Sullivan, at  pp. 766 -67; Tuffnail , at para. 104). There is nothing unfair about changing \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 157 ---\n \n a person’s entitlement to a preliminary inquiry when it is unclear if they will ever have \nthe right to one, depending on the Crown’s exercise of discretion on whether to charge \nor what charge to lay, or how to prosecute the charge that is laid.  \n[252]  I now turn to the respondents’ alternative submission, that the first \nappearance of the accused is the point where there is no additional contingency and the \nright has vested, given the accu sed can make a request for a preliminary inquiry at any \ntime (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 9 and 45; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 3).  The \nrespondents say that, in Quebec, an accused generally reserves their election at first \nappearance (R.F. (Archambault), at  para. 68). After that point they may elect their mode \nof trial, and if they elect to be tried in the Superior Court, they may request a \npreliminary inquiry.  \n[253]  The Criminal Code provides that where an accused does not elect a mode \nof trial when put to their election they will be deemed to have elected to be tried by \njudge and jury (ss. 536(2) and (2.1) and 565(1",

Henein and \nM. R. Gourlay, at pp. 1150 -51). The accused may re -elect to another mode of trial \nwhere permitted by the Criminal Code (s. 561).  \n[254]  It is in this context that the respondents say a practice has developed in \nQuebec where an accused generally postpones (“ reporte ”) their election to a futur e \ntime. According to Nicolas Bellemare [ TRANSLATION ] “[i]n practice, at the appearance, \nthe election as to the mode of trial is postponed ” (“Les procédures précédant le procès \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 158 ---\n \n en matière criminelle”, in Collection de droit de l’École du Barreau du Québec 2 024-\n2025, vol. 12, Droit pénal - Procédure et preuve  (2024), 39, at p. 70 (emphasis added); \nsee also A. Gagnon -Rocque and J. Héroux, “Arrestation, comparution et mise en \nliberté”, in JurisClasseur  Québec — Collection Droit pénal — Preuve et procédure \npénales  (loose -leaf), fasc. 5, at No. 110). By deferring the election, the accused will \nobtain the benefit of disclosure and the opportunity to retain and be advised by counsel \n(ibid.; see also Henein and Gourlay, at p. 1150). In that sense, the “reserve” of the \nelection, noted by the court in the indictment, may be taken to confirm the accused can \nelect and request a preliminary inquiry at any time. From that point on, whether the \naccused will ultimate ly have a preliminary inquiry is dependent only on the law and \ntheir own actions.  \n[255]  Although this may be true of the first appearance in Quebec, this may not \nbe true of the first appearance across the country. In post -charge screening jurisdictions \n— which,  according to the Attorney General of Ontario, include Ontario, \nSaskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island (I.F., at para. \n15) — the eligibility for a preliminary inquiry remains contingent even after first \nappearance, as the accused  may not yet have the possibility to elect the mode of trial \n(ibid.; see also Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at ¶9.43 ). However, at some point \nin the pre -trial stage of a criminal proceeding, there may be no impediment to the \naccused’s election and p otential request for a preliminary inquiry.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 159 ---\n \n [256]  We must, of course, remain mindful that while criminal procedure is \nnational in scope, there is important variation in the specifics of how that procedure is \napplied across jurisdictions and levels of court (see,  e.g., S. Coughlan, Criminal \nProcedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 29). Local practices regarding the administration of \njustice can vary throughout the country, as long as they remain consistent with the \nenacted criminal law provisions.  \n[257]  The general issue here is  whether the right to a preliminary inquiry vests \nonce the accused is able, through their own choices and actions, such as electing their \nmode of trial and making a request for a preliminary inquiry, to ensure they have a \npreliminary inquiry.

In Quebec, therefore, this occurs on first \nappearance because that is when the election as to mode of trial is put to the accused. \nIn other provinces and territo ries, the manner in which the court acknowledges the \naccused’s deferral of these rights may vary.  \n[258]  There are fewer contingencies here than at earlier points in the criminal",

In effect, the choice between the Crown’s position and the \nrespondents’ alternative  depends on the answer to the question of whether actually \nmaking a request — rather than the ability to make a request — is a precondition of \nvestin g. Not every formal requirement in a proceeding is necessary for a right to vest. \nBecause the right to a preliminary inquiry is a statutory right, the answer turns on the \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 160 ---\n \n terms through which Parliament defines that right as seen through the lens of the leg al \nvalues underlying transitional law.  \n[259]  Under the legislation considered in Puskas , the right to appeal was not \nframed as contingent on a notice of appeal being filed ( Cr. C. , s. 691(2)), even though \nan existing right to appeal could be lost if the appellan t did not file a notice of appeal \nwithin the applicable time limit (see, e.g., Supreme Court Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. S -26, ss. \n58 to 60). It is unsurprising then that the notice of appeal was not identified as a \ncondition precedent to the right of appeal at i ssue in that case ( Puskas , at para. 15).  \n[260]  In contrast to the right of appeal in Puskas , s. 535 frames the request as a \nprecondition of the existence of the right . Section 535 expressly provides that “[i]f .  . . \na request has been made for a preliminary inqu iry, the justice shall .  . . inquire into the \ncharge”. The French version reads: “ Lorsqu’un[e] .  . . demande a été présentée en vue \nde la tenue d’une enquête préliminaire .  . ., le juge de paix  doit .  . . enquêter sur \nl’accusation .  . . .” The Criminal  Code ties the request to the election of mode of trial \n(or deemed election). A preliminary inquiry will not be available if the accused elects \n“to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a \npreliminary inquiry” (s. 536(2)). S ection 536(2) further requires that where an accused \nis charged with an indictable offence punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, \nother than an offence that is listed in s. 469, the justice put the accused to an election \nin words that include: “.  . . you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the \nprosecutor requests one”.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 161 ---\n \n [261]  There is no express requirement of form as to how an accused may make \nthat request other than that it be made under s. 536(4) of the Criminal Code . Section \n536(4) provides (and provided prior to the 2019 amendments to the Criminal Code ) \nthat where an accused elects (or is deemed to have elected) to be tried other than before \na judge of the provincial court, “ the justice shall , . . . on the request o f the accused or \nthe prosecutor  made at that time or within the period fixed by rules of court .  . . or . . . \nby the justice, hold a preliminary inquiry into the charge ”. Under s.  536(4.1) the \ninformation must be endorsed to show “whether the accused or th e prosecutor has \nrequested that a preliminary inquiry be held”. The request also has concrete legal \nconsequences that go beyond the obligation of the justice to hold the preliminary \ninquiry. For instance, it may also fix the conditions on which the accused  has a right to \nre-elect the mode of trial (see Cr. C. , s. 561). Read together, the provisions surrounding \nthe election of the mode of trial make clear that what triggers the holding of a \npreliminary inquiry is both the election of the mode of trial in whi ch a preliminary \ninquiry is available (trial other than before",

Read together, the provisions surrounding \nthe election of the mode of trial make clear that what triggers the holding of a \npreliminary inquiry is both the election of the mode of trial in whi ch a preliminary \ninquiry is available (trial other than before a judge of the provincial court for an offence \nthat is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment), and the request for a \npreliminary inquiry to be held. Indeed, even where the accused is s ure to be tried by a \nmode through which a preliminary inquiry is available, the statute still mandates a \nrequest (s. 536(4)). And absent a request, the justice “shall” fix the date for the trial (s. \n536(4.3)).  \n[262]  Thus, s. 535 (as well as s. 536(2), (2.1) and (4)) makes clear that there is a \ndistinction between the ability to make a request, and the right to a preliminary inquiry. \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 162 ---\n \n The latter can only be sufficiently vested once a request has been made (see also \ns. 555(1.1) and (1.2)).  \n[263]  In some cases, recourse to  the broader statutory context may reveal that \nexplicit textual requirements are only mere formalities, as opposed to preconditions, or \nreveal more preconditions that may not be directly apparent from the text itself. \nHowever, this is a statutory right and  the text and statutory scheme make clear that \nParliament intended to make the availability of a preliminary inquiry conditional on a \nrequest actually having been made. It therefore cannot be dismissed as a mere \nprocedural or formal step required to exerci se a right that has already vested. Rather, it \ndefines whether a preliminary inquiry can be held.  \n[264]  Granted, where the contingencies that are dependent on third parties have \nbeen removed (i.e., a charge has been laid and the prosecution has decided to proce ed \nby way of indictment), the accused may have a greater expectation that depending on \ntheir election of mode of trial, they would be able to eventually request a preliminary \ninquiry. In Quebec for example, the accused may formally postpone or “reserve” th eir \nelection. But in my view, whether the accused postpones or “reserves” their election, \nor merely indicates they are not ready to elect, cannot be determinative of the temporal \napplication of s. 535. This distinction finds no basis in the Criminal Code . Whether the \naccused has the opportunity, based on the jurisdiction in which they find themselves, \nto reserve their right, or whether they are at a point in the process at which they could \nelect and make a request at any time, the further steps the accused needs to take to \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 163 ---\n \n secure a preliminary inquiry are substantively identical: they must elect, or be deemed \nto elect, their mode of trial and then make a request for a preliminary inquiry for which \nthey are eligible under the Criminal Code . In each case, the accused may have expected \nthat acquiring the right to a preliminary inquiry was entirely within their control. \nHowever, the classification of a right as vested is based on the facts as they exist when \nthe new rule comes into force, not on facts that could have existed had the accused \nchosen to proceed differently. In light of the manner in which Parliament has framed \nthe statutory right to a preliminary inquiry, it is not the ability to make a request, but \nrather the request itself that acts as a statutory precondition to acquiring the right.  \n[265]  The statutory text of s. 535 makes plain that the request is central to the \nright to the preliminary inquiry. This has been so since 2004 when the previous \namendment came into force transforming the right to a prelimin ary inquiry as one \nconditional on a request being made ( Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001 , s. 24). \nBecause there was a 90 -day period before the amendment at issue came into force, the \naccused had notice of the rule change. In this context, Parliament signal ed that any \nunfairness resulting from depriving the accused of expectations that a request could  be \nmade would give way in favour of the clear legislative direction that a request must  be \nmade.

There is always an element of unfairness, to a lesser or great er extent depending \non the circumstances, when Parliament changes a rule that an accused may have \nthought would be of benefit. The presumptions of temporal application recognize, \nhowever, that only where all the preconditions mandated by Parliament have be en met \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 164 ---\n \n will an accused have a statutory right with which Parliament presumably wished not to \ninterfere.  \n[266]  There are important rule of law considerations animating the availability \nof preliminary inquiries in s. 535. The requirement that a request be made ens ures there \nis a clear rule that can be given a uniform interpretation across Canada, and avoids the \nneed for a factual inquiry into whether there are any impediments to a given accused’s \nability to make a request. Parliament intended to create clear and re adily ascertainable \nconditions limiting the right to a preliminary inquiry in s. 535. And in determining the \ntemporal application of legislation, Parliament’s intent remains key. Recognizing the \nimportance of the actual request as a condition to the right to the inquiry therefore \nfollows Parliament’s choice of text and its intent. Thus, I conclude that a preliminary \ninquiry is not available under s. 535 until an actual request has been made.  \n[267]  Whether a request has been made is a factual question dependent o n the \ncircumstances of each individual case. As the Crown suggested in its oral arguments, \nan informal demand made outside of court (as for example during the 90 -day period \nbetween the new rule’s enactment and its coming into force) may be enough to \nconsti tute the equivalent of a “request” within the meaning of ss. 535 and 536(4) \n(transcript, at pp. 10 -11; see also R.S., at para. 15). It may depend on the rules of \npractice of the particular court. In sum, where the accused has not expressed a clear \ndemand f or a preliminary inquiry, the right to a preliminary inquiry has not vested. To \nconclude otherwise would be to ignore the specific way Parliament designed this right \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 165 ---\n \n — and its relationship to the rest of the criminal process. The Criminal Code permits \ncourts to set out rules that are best suited to the local context, provided they are not \ninconsistent with the Criminal Code itself (ss. 482 and 482.1). Variation in practice \nacross jurisdictions and courts can ensure that justice is administered in a manner \nresponsive to local circumstances.  \n[268]  My colleagues Justices Côté and Rowe advance another possibility, \nnamely that the right to a preliminary inquiry could have vested at the time charges \nwere laid. While the laying of a charge removes one of the most obvious  conditions \nprecedent for the exercise of the right, the availability of a preliminary inquiry still \nremains subject to the numerous contingencies described above. Beyond the need for a \nrequest, the Crown will not necessarily have elected how to proceed at  the time charges \nare laid, depending on the jurisdiction. In those circumstances, the accused cannot \nexpect that they will have a preliminary inquiry, given the Crown may either decide to \ncontinue to proceed by indictment, where a preliminary inquiry woul d be possible, or \nsummarily, where it would not.  \n[269]  My colleague Justice Kasirer advances a final possibility, that an accused \nhas a vested right as soon as they reserve the election of their mode of trial, due to the \nassurance they receive from the court abo ut the future availability of a preliminary \ninquiry (paras. 91 -92). There is no evidence in the record that when an accused reserves \ntheir election as to mode of trial, they receive a “ judicial undertaking ” that they will be \nprovided a preliminary inquiry on request (para. 91), a practice which has no basis in \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 166 ---\n \n the legislation. My colleague relies on transcript of the Court of Québec’s decision \ndenying Mr. Archambault a preliminary inquiry, which occurred more than a year after \nhe had reserved his election ( para. 88).

My colleague relies on transcript of the Court of Québec’s decision \ndenying Mr. Archambault a preliminary inquiry, which occurred more than a year after \nhe had reserved his election ( para. 88). The submissions made on behalf of Mr. \nArchambault during that hearing are not evidence of what occurred at the time of the \nreserve. Even if there were evidence that the local practice of courts in Quebec actually \ncreates, in accused persons, som e kind of reasonable reliance, the right at issue is \nconferred by Parliament, not by the courts. Courts do not, through their informal \npractices and representations, have the power to vest a statutory right in an accused that \nwas never extended to them by the legislation.  \n(c) Conclusion on the Temporal Application of Section 535  \n[270]  The amendment to s. 535 was not purely procedural because it can interfere \nwith a substantive legal interest by depriving an accused of the opportunity to be \ndischarged at a preliminary  inquiry. As that right vests only once a request for a \npreliminary inquiry is made, the new rule is presumed to apply unless the request has \nbeen made before the amendment came into force.  \n[271]  Therefore, properly interpreted, the new limitation in s. 535 app lies to all \naccused persons where a request for a preliminary inquiry was not made before the \namendment came into force on September 19, 2019.  \n(3) Application to the Respondents  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 167 ---\n \n [272]  As of September 19, 2019, no request for a preliminary inquiry had been \nmade by Mr . Archambault, nor by Mr. Grenier. They each eventually made a request, \nbut only months later. Can their reserve or deferral of their election, which occurred \nbefore September 19, 2019, amount to a request? In other words, is it possible, to \ncharacterize t he “reserve” of the election of the mode of trial at first appearance in \nQuebec as the equivalent of a “request” for a preliminary inquiry as required by s. 535?  \n[273]  As noted above, a “reserve” amounts to delaying the accused’s election to \na later date. It does not mean the accused has elected a mode of trial, or made their \nintention for a preliminary inquiry known. There is no factual basis on which this Court \ncould conclude that a reserve or deferral of the election by the respondents indicated \nan actual d esire to have a preliminary inquiry. In the case of Mr. Grenier, for example, \nthe Court of Québec merely noted on the indictment that at first appearance, he had \n[TRANSLATION ] “postponed his election to a later date” (A.R., vol.  I, at pp. 7 -8). The \n“reserv e” or postponement of an election does not amount to an actual request for a \npreliminary inquiry for the purposes of s. 535 Cr. C.   \n[274]  Assimilating a reserve to a request would effectively mean that the mere \n“possibility” of making a request is enough, despit e the clear intent of Parliament to \nmake the request an essential prerequisite to the existence of this statutory right. Merely \nleaving open the possibility that a request may be made in the future is insufficient for \nthis purpose.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 168 ---\n \n [275]  The respondents had no vested right at the time the new rule came into \nforce, but merely the possibility of acquiring such a right had they made requests before \nthe ninetieth day after its enactment. As this Court held in Expropriation Tribunal , at \np. 742: “A  vested right .  . . does not include a right which could have been exercised \nbut was not, and which is no longer available under the law”.  \nC. Interpreting the New Rule  \n[276]  Having found that an accused in the circumstances of the respondents is \nsubject to the new rule at s. 535, I tu rn to whether such an accused would be eligible \nfor a preliminary inquiry in accordance with its terms. This question turns on whether \nthey qualify as “an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable \nby 14 years or more of imprisonm ent” within the meaning of s. 535.

This question turns on whether \nthey qualify as “an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable \nby 14 years or more of imprisonm ent” within the meaning of s. 535. This case raises \nthe issue squarely.  \n[277]  Mr. Grenier is charged with sexual interference and sexual assault, which, \nwhere the victim is a person under the age of 16 years, are now punishable by up to 14 \nyears. As for Mr. Arch ambault, he is charged with indecent assault on another male \nperson (who was under the age of 16 years at the time of the alleged offence), which \nhas no modern equivalent. He argues that the alleged criminal conduct would likely \nnow be charged under either  s. 271 or ss. 151 to 153 of the Criminal Code (R.F. \n(Archambault), at para. 76); these offences are all now punishable by up to 14 years’ \nimprisonment.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n \n [278]  In each case, the respondents have the benefit of s. 11(i) of the Charter  \nwhich, consistent with the pr esumptions discussed above, limits their personal liability \nto the maximum term of imprisonment in force at the time of the commission of the \noffences charged. Thus, the respondents face a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment in \nrespect of each offence with w hich they are charged — although the acts they are \nalleged to have committed would, if committed today, each be punishable by \nimprisonment for a maximum of 14 years . None of the offences charged attract a \nmaximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment . \n[279]  The Crown submits that only an accused facing a personal liability  of 14 \nyears’ imprisonment or more for an offence can ask for a preliminary inquiry (A.F., at \npara. 120). For this new rule, the yardstick by which the seriousness of an offence is \nmeasured is the maximum sentence faced by the accused regarding that offenc e. \n[280]  The respondents answer that Parliament’s intent was to keep the \navailability of preliminary inquiries for the most serious offences, as determined by \nreference to contemporaneous societal values and the current maximum sentence of the \noffence (R.F. (Arc hambault), at paras. 82 and 89; R.F. (Grenier), at paras. 35 -37). They \nagree with the intervener the Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) that the focus \ncannot be the personal liability of the accused, because what matters is the seriousness \nof the offence, not the offender (I.F., at para. 8, citing R. v. Windebank , 2021 ONCA \n157, 154 O.R. (3d) 573,  at paras. 36 -37). The respondents submit  that modern societal \nviews on the seriousness of the offence are reflected in the sentencing principles and \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 170 ---\n \n the actu al sentences that an accused would receive today. In addition, they say it is not \nfair to penalize them based on the fact that they benefit from Charter  rights.  \n[281]  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the text in s. 535, read in context \nand in light o f the purposes of the provision, requires that the accused actually be liable \nto 14 or more years’ imprisonment in respect of the offence for a preliminary inquiry \nto be available. Parliament intended for only those accused facing greater maximum \njeopardy to retain the benefit of a preliminary inquiry.  \n(1) The 14 -Year Imprisonment Threshold  \n[282]  This issue requires interpreting the scope of the 14 -year imprisonment \nthreshold in s. 535 of the Criminal Code . While the respondents and the Crown agree \nthat the maximum p enalty has been used in s. 535 as a marker of the seriousness of the \noffences for which preliminary inquiries remain available (A.F., at paras. 108 -11; R.F. \n(Archambault), at para. 77; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 37) , the question is whether the \nmaximum penal ty is that of the specific offence with which the accused is charged — \nor whether it is that of the broader class of offence.

    "text": " seriousness of the \noffences for which preliminary inquiries remain available (A.F., at paras. 108 -11; R.F. \n(Archambault), at para. 77; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 37) , the question is whether the \nmaximum penal ty is that of the specific offence with which the accused is charged — \nor whether it is that of the broader class of offence. In undertaking this statutory \ninterpretation exercise, I will consider the text, context and purpose of the provision, \nand then ad dress specific concerns raised by the parties.  \n[283]  I turn first to the text of s. 535. A preliminary inquiry is only available when \n“an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years \nor more of imprisonment is before a justice  and a request has been made for a \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 171 ---\n \n preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4)”. The French text similarly centres on “ un \nprévenu inculpé d’un acte criminel passible d’un emprisonnement de quatorze ans ou \nplus”. The focus of the text is on the accused and the accused’s proceedings: the offence \nwith which “an accused .  . . is charged”, and whether a request has been made for them \nto have a preliminary inquiry. It is not focused on hypotheticals or the general nature \nof the offence. The indictment sets out th e particulars (including the date) of the offence \nthat the accused must answer and limits the criminal proceedings. As illustrated in the \ncase of Mr. Archambault, there is no modern equivalent to the offence with which he \nis charged; he is charged with ind ecent assault on another male person, which is \npunishable by 10 years’ imprisonment.  \n[284]  Of course, the seriousness of an offence is not measured in reference to the \nindividual circumstances surrounding the offender, such as the possibility of a \ndangerous off ender designation ( Windebank , at paras. 35 -37). Rather, as Nordheimer \nJ.A. explained in R. v. S.S. , 2021 ONCA 479, 493 C.R.R. (2d) 251, the relevance of the \naccused is that the provision speaks to the specific offence with which that accused \nactually has been charged (para. 19), as opposed to a hypothetical offence involving \nthe similar alleged actions occurring in the present day.  \n[285]  This interpretation of these words in the Criminal Code is also consistent \nwith how those words have been understood in other statutes dealing with similar \nsubject matter. The presumption of consistent expression provides that the meaning of \nrecurring patterns of expression is presumed to remain the same “both within a statute \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 172 ---\n \n and across statutes” ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship  and Immigration) v. Vavilov , \n2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 44).  \n[286]  In Tran , this Court was concerned with s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001, c. 27, which defined the “serious criminality” of a \npermanent reside nt or foreign national to include “having been convicted .  . . of an \noffence .  . . punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years”. The \nmaximum penalty for the offence with which Mr. Tran was convicted had been raised \nfrom a maximum term  of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years between its commission and \nsentencing. This Court unanimously concluded Mr. Tran’s conviction did not fall under \nthe umbrella of serious criminality, within the meaning of s. 36(1)(a), as the only \nacceptable interpretation  was that the provision referred to the maximum term “that \n[Mr. Tran] could have received at the time of the commission of the offence”  (para. \n35). The language of the provision was taken to refer to the circumstances of the \noffender, i.e., the maximum pen alty he had faced, rather than the “abstract maximum \npenalty” (para. 38).  \n[287]  There is no reason to think Parliament meant something different in s. 535 \nof the Criminal Code  by the analogous formulation “an accused who is charged with \nan indictable offence tha t is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment”. That s. \n36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act speaks to the relevant offences \n",

    "text": " alty he had faced, rather than the “abstract maximum \npenalty” (para. 38).  \n[287]  There is no reason to think Parliament meant something different in s. 535 \nof the Criminal Code  by the analogous formulation “an accused who is charged with \nan indictable offence tha t is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment”. That s. \n36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act speaks to the relevant offences \nafter conviction, while s. 535 speaks to offences on which persons have been charged \nbut not convicted, is a distinction without a difference. In both contexts Parliament is \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 173 ---\n \n distinguishing offences based on their severity in reference to their maximum term of \nimprisonment. This Court held in Tran we must look to the actual offence committed \nby the person direct ly referenced in the provision, not a hypothetical offence committed \nin other circumstances where it would attract a higher maximum sentence.  \n[288]  This focus on the specific proceedings of the accused also follows the \nbroader context of the new provision, which  makes clear that preliminary inquiries are \nnow generally  unavailable. Their availability is now restricted only to those accused \nwho meet specific and clear conditions. The accused’s personal jeopardy is usually \nreadily ascertainable. The maximum liabilit y of the offence with which an accused has \nactually been charged and convicted must be determined in sentencing them. If the \naccused may be liable for at least 14 years of imprisonment in respect of an offence \ncharged, then a preliminary inquiry should be available if either the accused or the \nprosecution requests one.  \n[289]  Thus, I disagree with the intervenor the Criminal Lawyers’ Association \n(Ontario) that relying on personal liability would lead to uncertainty or absurd results, \nfor example when the dates of  the offence straddle the date of the increase in the \nmaximum penalty (I.F., at paras. 13 -17). Rather, it is determining maximum liability \nby reference to a hypothetical that introduces uncertainty: what would the maximum \npunishment be for the alleged cond uct underlying those offences if that conduct \noccurred in the present day, or on September 19, 2019, the date s. 535 came into force? \nObviously, an accused actually facing 14 years’ imprisonment (no matter when s. 535 \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 174 ---\n \n came into force) should have the right  to request a preliminary inquiry. The efficiency \nand coherence of the scheme is focused on maintaining the benefit of a preliminary \ninquiry for the accused facing serious jeopardy, where the preliminary inquiry is \nrequested.  \n[290]  Finally, the overall purpose o f limiting the availability of the preliminary \ninquiry was to reduce delays, to alleviate the burden of witnesses and victims of \ntestifying twice, and more generally, to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice \nsystem (see R. v. C.T.B. , 2021 NSCA 58,  at para. 39; Windebank , at paras. 19 -22; S.S., \nat para. 14). In limiting the availability of a preliminary inquiry, Parliament decided \nthat it was not  a necessary procedural step to a fair trial.  \n[291]  These broader purposes in reducing the availability of the preliminary \ninquiry inform the specific objectives of s. 535. Although Parliament kept the \navailability of preliminary inquiries in serious cases, the exception for serious offences \nmust itself be read “in light of the problem [the legislation] was intende d to address” \n(Canada 3000 Inc. (Re) , 2006 SCC 24, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 36).  \n[292]  Thus, s. 535 represents an exception for serious offences. While Parliament \nwas seeking to  reduce systemic obstacles to the Charter  right to a trial without \nunreasonable  delay, the exception  recognizes that a preliminary inquiry can still be of \nsignificant benefit to an accused facing more significant legal jeopardy. The \nParliamentary debates reveal a key concern that the rule limiting access to preliminary \ninquiries be c lear and certain. Other proposed amendments to Bill C -75, which would \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n \n have expanded the eligibility for preliminary inquiries based on the opinion of the \njustice as to the “best interests of the administration of justice”, were ultimately not \nadopted by Pa rliament ( Windebank , at paras. 24 -25).

Other proposed amendments to Bill C -75, which would \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n \n have expanded the eligibility for preliminary inquiries based on the opinion of the \njustice as to the “best interests of the administration of justice”, were ultimately not \nadopted by Pa rliament ( Windebank , at paras. 24 -25). In speaking against that proposal, \nthe Minister of Justice expressed the concern that their complex criteria would lead to \nfurther litigation and delay  (House of Commons Debates , vol. 148, No. 435, 1st Sess., \n42nd Par l., June 17, 2019, at p. 29245 ). Given these purposes, it is difficult to accept \nthat Parliament adopted a threshold meant to invite a hypothetical inquiry into what the \nmaximum sentence for the accused would have been had it occurred at another time.  \n[293]  The respondents and the interveners Association québécoise des avocats et \navocates de la defense (“AQAAD”) and Association des avocats de la défense de \nMontréal -Laval -Longueuil (“AADM”) argue those accused of historical child sexual \noffences, even where they b enefit from a lesser maximum punishment, actually face the \nsame criminal jeopardy as those accused of more recent offences, since a judge \nconsiders the current maximum liability in determining the proper sentence (R.F. \n(Archambault), at para. 93; I.F. (AQA AQ and AADM), at para. 13 ). The actual \nsentences imposed — and the associated stigma — will be more severe than they would \nhave been at the time of the commission of the offence (R.F. (Grenier), at para. 37).  \n[294]  Granted, in exercising discretion in sentencing, a sentencing judge must \nconsider the current values of society, as reflected by the maximum sentences in force \nfor the offence ( R. v. Friesen , 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 100; see also \nR. v. Bertrand Marchand , 2023 SCC 26, at para s. 31, 46 -47, 153 and 167 -68; Poulin , \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 176 ---\n \n at paras. 3 -5). Sentences must not only be proportionate to an individual’s culpability \n(Cr. C. , s. 718.1), they must serve sentencing’s fundamental purpose of maintaining a \n“just, peaceful and safe society” (s. 718). In particular, for sexual offences against \nchildren, sentencing serves the primary objectives of denunciation and deterrence (s. \n718.01). The principle of parity requires that courts impose similar sentences for similar \noffenders in similar circumstances ( s. 718.2(b)). By nature, the court’s role in \nsentencing includes consideration of “society’s legitimate shared values and concerns” \n(R. v. Nasogaluak , 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 49; see also R. v. \nStuckless , 2019 ONCA 504, 146 O.R. (3d) 752,  at para. 112).  \n[295]  But sentencing principles and societal values are of little assistance in \ninterpreting the intention of Parliament under s. 53 5. The proxy for seriousness selected \nby Parliament here is the maximum sentence carried by the offence charged — not the \nfit sentence. The maximum sentence is not determined in reference to the discretionary \nsentencing regime. Even if the fit sentence would now be more severe than it would \nhave been at the time of the commission of the offence, the maximum sentence the \naccused faces is the same. To ensure its objective of a clear and predictable standard \non which to determine eligibility for a preliminary inquiry, Parliament opted to focus \non the maximum sentence. Sentencing principles do not help to interpret this statutory \nright to a preliminary inquiry  which is determined by reference to the maximum  penalty \nan accused faces for the conduct that gives rise to the offence with which they are \ncharged.  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 177 ---\n \n [296]  The respondents argue that it would be unfair to penalize accused p ersons, \nby denying them a preliminary inquiry, simply because they benefit from the protection \nunder s. 11(i) of the Charter (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 83 -85; R.F",

(Archambault), at paras. 83 -85; R.F. (Grenier), at \npara. 50). In my view, however, the respondents are not penalized; they ar e simply in \nthe same position of any accused who faces a maximum sentence of less than 14 years.  \n[297]  Section 11(i) of the Charter  provides: “ Any person charged with an \noffence has the right .  . . if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the \noffence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to \nthe benefit of the lesser punishment.” Even setting aside the constitutional protection \nprovided by s. 11(i),  there is a common law rule that an accused’s penal consequences  \nmust generally be determined in reference to the law in force at the time of the \ncommission of the offence ( Poulin , at para. 60; K.R.J. , at para. 22). An accused would, \npresumptively, still be liable only for the lesser punishment in force at the time of the \ncommission of the offence ( S.S., at para. 16; C.T.B. , at paras. 25, 34 and 45 -46; \nInterpretation Act , s. 43(d) and (e)), in this case a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment.  \n[298]  That the same type of alleged criminal conduct would today give rise to \nthe benef it of a preliminary inquiry works no injustice, as contemporaneous offenders \nface greater jeopardy, as reflected by the current 14 -year maximum sentence. The result \nfor both offenders may be different, but they are “treated fairly [and] they each receive \nprotections which are connected to them and their proceedings” ( Poulin , at para. 96 \n(emphasis deleted)).  \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 178 ---\n \n [299]  Thus, I cannot accept the interpretation urged by the respondents. It \ncontradicts the ordinary meaning of the text and would blunt Parliament’s goals o f \nreducing the number of preliminary inquiries and of creating a clear criterion limiting \neligibility for a preliminary inquiry.  \n[300]  The 14 -year requirement imposed by s. 535, read in its entire context, \nleaves room for only one interpretation. Parliament chos e to restrict preliminary \ninquiries  based not on the general nature of the conduct underlying the offence, as it \ncould have done, but through the proxy of the maximum jeopardy faced by an accused \nfor the actual offence with which they are charged. I agree with the Nova Scotia Court \nof Appeal that the requirement imposed by the text of s. 535 is “clear and unequivocal” \n(C.T.B. , at para. 38; see also S.S., at paras. 15 -16). As noted in S.S., to achieve its \npurpose of restricting the entitlement to preliminary inquiries, Parliament “expressly \ncoupled [that] entitlement .  . . to the maximum sentence for the offence charged” (para. \n15; see also C.T.B. , at para. 29).  \n[301]  I conclude that an accused has the right to make a request for a preliminary \ninquiry if charged with an offence for which their maximum sentence is imprisonment \nof 14 years or more.  \n(2) Application to the Respondents  \n[302]  Here, neither respondent’s request for a preliminary inquiry met the \nrequirements of the new s. 535, as the offences with which they are charged are each \n2024 SCC 35 (CanLII)\n\n--- Page 179 ---\n \n punishable by a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. Mr. Grenier, even though the \nalleged offences with which he is charged would now each be punishable by up to 14 \nyears if  they occurred today, benefits from the lesser sentences in force at the time of \nthe alleged commission of the offences. Mr. Archambault is charged under a section of \nthe Criminal Code  that has been repealed, but the alleged offence with which he is \ncharge d remains punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment.
